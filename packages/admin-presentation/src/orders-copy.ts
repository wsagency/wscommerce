/**
 * The Orders screen's authored copy — the strings BOTH Orders screens put on
 * screen (INC-20; the detail half completed in INC-21).
 *
 * WHY A SCREEN'S COPY IS IN A SHARED PACKAGE AT ALL. Normally it would not be:
 * copy belongs with the screen that renders it. But for the length of this
 * migration there are TWO Orders screens rendering the same records side by
 * side in the same sidebar, and ADR-0014 requires both to keep working until
 * the replacement is proven. That makes every string here a cross-surface
 * contract rather than a screen's private business: an operator comparing the
 * two — which is the entire point of shipping them together — must not have to
 * work out whether two different sentences describe the same state.
 *
 * The React tier's first cut copied these by hand. That is exactly how the
 * Block Kit screen came to have three date formats and two money formatters,
 * and the answer here is the answer INC-13 and INC-20 already gave: one
 * definition, two importers, and a test on each side that fails when they
 * disagree.
 *
 * INC-20 SHIPPED THE LIST HALF AND RECORDED THE REST AS A RIDER. It shared the
 * intro line, the two zero states and the reconciliation sentence, and left
 * roughly a dozen DETAIL strings hand-copied into `order-detail.tsx` with a
 * note saying so. That rider is closed here, and closing it FOUND FOUR
 * DIVERGENCES the note had predicted in the abstract — the two surfaces had
 * already drifted apart in the weeks between:
 *
 *  1. `“cancelled”` — the Block Kit copy uses typographic quotes and the React
 *     copy had straight ones, in both the cancel banner and the cancel confirm.
 *  2. The reconciliation note: Block Kit says "logs your decision only … Refund
 *     in Money if the buyer is owed one"; React had shortened it to the first
 *     clause and dropped the next step entirely.
 *  3. The over-refund refusal: Block Kit names the amount, the remaining
 *     ceiling AND what to enter instead; React said "Amount too high — … remains
 *     refundable. Nothing was changed." — the same fact without the instruction.
 *  4. The refunds-are-additive warning: Block Kit's opens with "Review the
 *     amount on the next step", which is TRUE ONLY THERE (the React screen
 *     collapsed the staged review into a confirm dialog). That one is a
 *     genuine per-surface difference, so the shared constant is the sentence
 *     they agree on and the Block Kit screen prefixes its own step reference —
 *     see {@link REFUND_ADDITIVE_NOTE}.
 *
 * Each is the kind of gap that is invisible until an operator reads both
 * screens, which is exactly what this migration asks them to do.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL HAND-COPIED, NAMED RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE FOUND. Every piece
 * of PROSE both Orders screens render is here, plus the labels INC-21's review
 * named individually (the fulfilment form, the list search, the back control).
 * Roughly sixty short FIELD LABELS and TABLE HEADERS on the detail — `Subtotal`,
 * `Postal code`, `Line total`, `Refunded by`, the four tab names — are still
 * written twice. They are mechanical and they should move, by the same argument
 * `products-copy.ts` makes for its own field vocabulary; they are not moved
 * HERE because INC-21 is the Pricing & inventory migration and a sixty-string
 * sweep of a different screen is its own change with its own diff to read. It
 * is recorded in that increment's commit body as a follow-up rather than left
 * as an unmarked gap: the risk is a label drifting on one surface, which is
 * exactly what this module exists to prevent.
 *
 * WHEN THE BLOCK KIT SCREEN IS RETIRED, this module goes back to
 * `@otta-sh/admin-react` and stops being shared. It is a migration artefact and
 * should be read as one.
