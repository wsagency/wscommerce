/**
 * The two strings a refund control puts in front of an operator, shared by both
 * admin surfaces (INC-20).
 *
 * WHY THESE TWO, AND NOTHING ELSE FROM THE ORDERS SCREEN. Almost every other
 * string on that screen is composed server-side and arrives at the React tier
 * already rendered. These cannot be: a partial refund's confirm text names the
 * amount the operator just typed, so it is composed in the browser, at click
 * time, from a figure the server has not seen yet. A React screen would
 * therefore need its own copy — and "its own copy" of a REFUND CONFIRM is the
 * one place in this console where drift moves money. `refundCapabilityText`
 * travels with it because the two are read together and read as one warning.
 *
 * They live here rather than in `@otta-sh/plugin` for the reason the whole
 * package exists: `@otta-sh/admin-react` may not import the plugin (ADR-0014
 * Decision 3). Pure string work, no IO, no wire types — the signatures take
 * primitives precisely so this module never learns what an order looks like.

/**
 * `confirm.text` — exactly two sentences, ≤200 (§1): one naming the concrete
 * ORDER, amount and recipient, one naming the consequence.
 *
 * THE ORDER COMES FIRST, and it is the reason this function takes an id at all
 * (D4). Amount and recipient are the two attributes a repeat customer's orders
 * SHARE, so a dialog naming only those is a dialog that cannot tell the operator
 * which of two candidates the money is about to leave. `shortIdFixed` is used
 * rather than `shortIdsFor` because a confirm renders against one record with no
 * candidate set in hand; at 8 characters it is a visible superset of the
 * 4-character prefix the operator just read in the list row.
 *
 * QUOTES MARK UNTRUSTED INPUT, AND NOTHING ELSE (review round 3, finding 2).
 * `recipient` may be caller-supplied, unverified free text — this function
 * has no way to know, so a real recipient is ALWAYS quoted (review finding
 * N3), delimited so an operator can see exactly where the token begins and
 * ends rather than reading it as an unbounded run of the sentence's own
 * prose. {@link UNNAMED_REFUND_RECIPIENT} is the ONE exception: it is
 * authored BY THIS MODULE, never by a caller, so quoting it would claim a
 * provenance it does not have — the same marks used to say "this text came
 * from the buyer" wrapped around a system phrase. The rule only holds
 * because the delimiter cannot be forged from the other end either: a
 * caller passing untrusted text through this function must escape a literal
 * `"` in it BEFORE calling (`order-detail.tsx`'s `escapeQuoteForRecipient`),
 * because this function has no way to tell an intentional close-quote from
 * one embedded in the value it is quoting.
 *
 * The recipient is dropped when a long buyer handle would push the string over
 * budget — the id and the amount are never the thing that goes. Truncating a
 * confirm dialog mid-sentence would be worse than a slightly less specific one,
 * and the budget is a hard rule (X-11). This is a BACKSTOP, not the primary
 * defence against a crafted value that stays under budget while reshaping the
 * sentence around it — a short recipient never reaches this branch at all, so
 * a caller expecting a bound on a value that legitimately fits the budget
 * still owns its own clamp (`order-detail.tsx`'s `REFUND_RECIPIENT_MAX_LEN`).
