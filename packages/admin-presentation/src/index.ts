/**
 * `@otta-sh/admin-presentation` — the admin console's presentation primitives,
 * and the answer to a question INC-19 recorded and deliberately did not answer:
 * where does the React tier's `formatMoney` come from?
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. There are now two admin surfaces — the Block Kit
 * screens in `@otta-sh/plugin` and the React console in `@otta-sh/admin-react`
 * — and the console may not import the plugin. ADR-0014 Decision 3 gives it
 * exactly one data path (HTTP to `otta`'s existing authenticated admin routes),
 * and `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`'s `console-imports-no-workspace-package` makes
 * that mechanical: a static import of `@otta-sh/plugin` would be a second data
 * path, compiled in and invisible to the empty capability set the console is
 * pinned on. That rule's own comment names the bill this package pays:
 *
 *   > INC-20 owes the React tier a formatMoney, and G1 says it must come from
 *   > SHARING the existing function (a new presentation package both sides
 *   > import), never from writing a second one.
 *
 * `format-money.ts` had already named the trigger from the other side — extract
 * "only when a second real consumer package exists". INC-20 is the increment
 * where one does.
 *
 * WHAT IS IN IT, AND WHY EXACTLY THIS. Everything the two surfaces must AGREE
 * on when rendering the same record, and nothing else:
 *
 *  - **Money** (`money.ts`, `format-money.ts`) — G1. One renderer, one set of
 *    brands, integer minor units throughout. Two implementations of currency
 *    formatting is the failure mode the rule exists to prevent.
 *  - **Dates** (`datetime.ts`) — the console's ONE date dialect, `8 Jul 2026,
 *    10:30 UTC`. INC-13 spent an increment collapsing three answers to "what
 *    time did this happen?" into one; a React screen with its own
 *    `Intl.DateTimeFormat` would make it three again, and the operator would
 *    meet the disagreement one click apart, exactly as before.
 *  - **Short ids** (`short-id.ts`) — D4/§1.3. The rule is cross-surface by
 *    construction: the picker's computed prefix must be a `startsWith` prefix
 *    of the confirm dialog's fixed 8, and now the React row's prefix must line
 *    up with the Block Kit row's for the same page of orders. Two
 *    implementations could not be checked against each other; one cannot
 *    disagree.
 *  - **Order status** (`order-status.ts`) — the `cancelled · closed` vocabulary
 *    and the state-machine-derived exception set it is computed from.
 *  - **The list outcome ladder** (`list-outcome.ts`) — five outcomes, of which
 *    "zero rows but another page behind them" is the one both surfaces got
 *    wrong independently. The DECISION is shared; the rendering is not.
 *  - **The Orders screen's authored copy** (`orders-copy.ts`) — a migration
 *    artefact, and the module doc there says so: two Orders screens render the
 *    same records side by side for the length of INC-20/21, which makes their
 *    strings a cross-surface contract rather than a screen's private business.
 *  - **Product status and stock** (`product-status.ts`, `stock-input.ts`) —
 *    INC-21. `statusLabel` and `onHandCell` were already shared across three
 *    Block Kit surfaces so a product could not read `low` in one place and
 *    plain in another; the React screen is a fourth. `parseStockQty` follows
 *    the money parser for the same reason it did: the React screen checks a
 *    quantity before opening a confirm dialog, and the Block Kit screen checks
 *    the same string server-side.
 *  - **The Pricing & inventory screen's authored copy** (`products-copy.ts`) —
 *    the same migration artefact as `orders-copy.ts`, one screen along,
 *    including the shared composition of the stock-degradation banner and the
 *    remove-stock confirm.
 *  - **Copy budgets and trimmers** (`copy.ts`) — §1's banner and label budgets
 *    and the `fit` they are applied with, which both screens' copy needs.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT IN IT. Anything with IO, anything React, anything EmDash, and any
 * wire type. Both consumers are hostile environments for a dependency: the
 * plugin's half is bundled into workerd by a harness that copies `src/` to a
 * bare scratch directory, and the console's half ships to a browser. So this
 * package depends on NOTHING, imports NOTHING, and is pure `Intl` and string
 * work — the same discipline `datetime.ts` already carried for the sandbox (G7)
 * and `short-id.ts` for allocation cost.
 *
 * DRIFT IS PROVEN, NOT TRUSTED, and by the suites that already existed:
 * `@otta-sh/plugin` re-exports these modules from their original paths, so
 * `packages/plugin/test/{format-money,money-parity,format-money.type-test}.ts`
 * and all 18 workerd sandbox suites now exercise THIS code through the plugin's
 * public surface. `test/` here covers the package on its own terms.
