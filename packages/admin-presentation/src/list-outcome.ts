/**
 * "How many rows, and what to say when there are none" — the console's list
 * outcome ladder, shared by both admin surfaces (INC-20 review).
 *
 * WHY THIS MOVED. The ladder was a Block Kit concern while there was one list
 * tier. INC-20's React Orders screen renders THE SAME LIST, and its first cut
 * reimplemented a two-branch version of a FIVE-outcome decision — so a page-2
 * miss claimed "No orders yet" (a whole-collection claim that render has not
 * earned) and a zero-row page with a cursor still behind it hid `Load more`
 * behind an empty state, stranding an operator mid-scan. Neither is a React bug;
 * both are what happens when a decision this carefully argued is written twice.
 *
 * SO THE DECISION IS SHARED AND THE RENDERING IS NOT. `listOutcome` returns a
 * discriminated union naming WHICH outcome and WHICH words; `list-detail.ts`
 * turns that into Block Kit blocks and `orders-list.tsx` turns it into React.
 * Both surfaces therefore agree on the hard part by construction, while each
 * keeps the part only it can do (a `Clear filters` button carrying a nav path,
 * versus an `onClick`).
 *
 * IO-FREE — pure `Intl` and string work, safe inside the workerd sandbox (G7)
 * and in a browser.

/**
 * `17 orders` · `1 order` · `25 orders on this page`, or `undefined` at zero.

 * admin list endpoints answer `{items, nextCursor, total}` — a page, a way to
 * ask for the next one, and (since INC-23) the exact size of the filtered set.
 * So the count this function renders is:
 *
 *  - the WHOLE (filtered) set — `17 orders` — whenever a `total` is present, on
 *    ANY page. It is a COUNT(*) under the same predicate as the page, so it is
 *    exact on page 3 of 3 as much as on page 1;
 *  - the WHOLE (filtered) set from the PAGE ITSELF — same wording — when there
 *    is no `total` but `complete` says the render is the first page of its
 *    filter AND there is no next cursor. Both halves are needed for that
 *    inference: page 1 of many counts a page, and page 3 of 3 knows nothing
 *    about pages 1 and 2 (keyset paging carries no running offset);
 *  - THIS PAGE otherwise — `25 orders on this page`, a smaller claim and a true
 *    one. That is the fallback for a service older than `total`, and for a
 *    level that deliberately WITHHOLDS one because the count it holds describes
 *    a different set of rows than the page does — a level that narrowed the
 *    fetched page itself, or one whose filter the service could not be asked to
 *    apply (products' "Low stock only" with no readable threshold: the service
 *    counted every product, so passing that number would caption the rows on
 *    screen as though the filter had run).
 *
 * `total` IS VALIDATED RATHER THAN TRUSTED, through {@link statedTotal} — which
 * is shared with the page count beneath this line precisely so that a figure one
 * of them refuses cannot reappear in the other.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE INVENTS A TOTAL. A count that says the set is bigger than the
 * page must have been told so by the service; a renderer that guessed one would
 * produce exactly the number an operator reconciles against and loses.
 *
 * ZERO RENDERS NO COUNT AT ALL — zero ROWS, whatever the `total` says, and a
 * `total` of zero. `0 orders` is never emitted: at zero the zero state already
 * says it in words, and a count line repeating it is the "unknown rendered as
 * 0" failure in a costume. A `total` above an empty page is the same
 * self-contradiction from the other direction, and is suppressed with it.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES IN THIS PACKAGE AND NOT IN `list-detail.ts`, where INC-23 wrote
 * it: because there are two list tiers now. The exact-count logic sitting on
 * the Block Kit side would have left the React Orders list saying
 * "25 orders on this page" while the Block Kit screen one sidebar entry away
 * said "137 orders" — a parity gap opening on the day INC-23 merged, on the
 * most-read line of the most-read screen. One implementation, both surfaces.

 * arithmetic over two values the render is already holding. A second query for
 * it would be a request bought with nothing.
 *
 * IT IS FED THE FIGURE THE COUNT LINE ACTUALLY STATED — `listOutcome`'s
 * `statedTotal`, not a raw payload number — and validates it again through the
 * same {@link statedTotal} gate. That is what keeps the two lines SOURCED from
 * one decision: a total the caption withheld cannot reappear as a page count
 * underneath it. It is not a proof that no two numbers on this screen can ever
 * read oddly together — the count and the page are still two statements taken at
 * two moments, and a write between them moves the boundary — but the DERIVATION
 * is single, so a disagreement can only come from the store changing, never from
 * the two lines having made up their minds separately. An absent, contradictory
 * or below-the-rows total yields `undefined`, which renders as an em dash, never
 * as `1` and never as `0`.
 *
 * WHERE THE REST OF THE PAGER LIVES: the client-side stack and the view it
 * derives are `PageTrail` and `pagerView` in `@otta-sh/admin-react`'s
 * `accumulate.ts`; the markup is `PagerButton` in its `ui.tsx`. This module owns
 * the words and the arithmetic and nothing else.
 *
 * A PAGE SIZE MUST BE A WHOLE POSITIVE NUMBER. Anything else describes no
 * paging at all, and dividing by it would invent a figure out of a malformed
 * one.
 *
 * IT IS AN APPROXIMATION UNDER CONCURRENCY, exactly as the count line is: the

 *    of the collection; it does not know where in it the operator is standing,
