/**
 * Money display formatting (Phase 2 §4.6) — the admin console's ONE sanctioned
 * money→display boundary, on BOTH surfaces, and the only place a money value
 * may touch a plain-string surface. It takes BRANDED types only (`./money.js`,
 * the documented mirror of the domain's brands): a raw `number` amount
 * or raw `string` currency is a compile error (pinned by
 * `packages/plugin/test/format-money.type-test.ts`, mirroring Phase 0's `Cents`
 * test).
 *
 * Lived in `@otta-sh/plugin` until INC-20, under a standing note to "extract to
 * a shared presentation package only when a second real consumer package exists
 * (ADR-0002 rule 5)". `@otta-sh/admin-react` is that second consumer: it renders
 * the same orders and may not import the plugin (ADR-0014 Decision 3), so G1's
 * "always `formatMoney(Cents, Currency, locale)`" is satisfiable only by both
 * surfaces calling THIS function. The plugin's `presentation/format-money.ts` is
 * now a re-export of it, which is what keeps the plugin's own money suites
 * covering this code. Formatting is explicitly NOT a domain concern; this sits
 * downstream of the branded types the domain defines.
 *
 * No float ever touches the amount: the minor→major conversion is integer
 * string arithmetic, and the exact decimal string is handed to
 * `Intl.NumberFormat.format` (which accepts numeric strings — ES2023 Intl,
 * supported by Node 20+ and workerd's V8). Localization and RTL-safety come
 * from Intl itself, never hand-assembled symbol+number strings.

 * because a screen holds a plain `number` off the wire and a plain currency
 * string, and the branding — with its two failure modes — has to happen
 * somewhere. Doing it here means it happens once.
 *
 * Three deliberate behaviours, all of them previously in `orders-page.ts` and
 * all of them now shared with the React console rather than reimplemented:
 *  - A negative amount formats as its absolute value with an explicit minus
 *    prefix, because `cents()` is branded NON-NEGATIVE and throws below zero.
 *  - An amount `Intl` cannot format renders {@link UNFORMATTABLE}, never
 *    `${CUR} ${minorUnits}`. The old fallback printed RAW MINOR UNITS in the one
 *    place it was least visible — a wrong number dressed as a formatted total.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT ACCEPT `null | undefined`, and that is a deliberate narrowing
 * (INC-20 review). The first cut took nullable money and dashed it, which reads
 * like defensive generosity and is the opposite: it moves "we have no amount"
 * from a COMPILE error to a dash on a money column, silently, at the one
 * boundary G1 exists to keep honest. No consumer needs it — every call site on
 * both surfaces holds a real `number` and a real currency by the time it gets
 * here, and a nullable one is a bug upstream that should fail `tsc` rather than
 * render. Absence that is genuinely a display state (a refund with no recorded
 * `createdAt`) is the CALLER's `??` and is visible where it happens.

/**
 * {@link formatAmount} for a money field that is legitimately UNSET.
 *
 * WHY THIS ONE *DOES* TAKE NULLS, when the note above argues at length that
 * `formatAmount` must not. The distinction is whether absence is a DISPLAY
 * STATE or a bug: an order total is always a number, so a nullable one there is
 * an upstream fault that should fail `tsc`. A product's price, compare-at and
 * unit cost are `null` in the ordinary course — a document synced from the CMS
 * before anyone priced it, a product with no was-price — and that is a fact to
 * render, not a fault to hide. Both halves are checked because a price without
 * a currency is not a price.
 *
 * ABSENT IS NOT ZERO: an unpriced product reads `—`, never `$0.00`. That is the
 * same rule the `On hand` cell keeps for counts and `rowCountLine` keeps for
 * row totals.
 *
 * IT REPLACED A SECOND RENDERER (INC-21). `products-page.ts` carried its own
 * `formatOptionalTotal`, whose Intl-failure branch fell back to
 * `` `${CUR} ${minorUnits}` `` — raw minor units in a money field, which is
 * precisely what G1 exists to forbid and what {@link UNFORMATTABLE}'s own note
 * calls "a wrong number dressed as a formatted total". Sharing this function
 * deletes that branch rather than copying it into the React tier.
