/**
 * How a product's LIFECYCLE and its STOCK read — the two cells whose wording is
 * the same convention, and which INC-21 needed on a second surface.
 *
 * WHY THESE TWO TRAVEL TOGETHER. They are one decision wearing two names:
 * **badge the exceptions, in words, and let the happy path be quiet.** INC-10
 * took that console-wide when it retired the last status pills, and both
 * functions here are it — `active` is one quiet word while every exception is
 * longer and says why (`inactive`, `deleted`, `active (not priced)`), and a
 * healthy count is a bare number while `0` and a low count carry their own
 * suffix (`0 · Out of stock`, `3 · Low`). Splitting them across two modules
 * would let one drift into a badge while the other stayed prose.
 *
 * WHY THEY MOVED HERE (INC-21). Both lived in `products-page.ts` and were
 * already shared across THREE Block Kit surfaces — the list table, the
 * `Open product` picker and the detail's identity strip — precisely so a
 * product could not read `low` in one place and plain in another. The React
 * Pricing & inventory screen is a fourth surface that cannot import
 * `@otta-sh/plugin` (ADR-0014 Decision 3), so the only way to keep that
 * property is the way INC-20 kept it for money, dates and short ids: one
 * definition, two importers.
 *
 * IO-FREE — string work only, safe inside the workerd sandbox (G7) and in a
 * browser.

 * The `On hand` cell — text, always, and never an empty string.
 *
 * THE BLOCK KIT CONSTRAINT THAT SHAPED IT, kept here because it is the reason
 * the return type is a string rather than a number plus a band: the pinned
 * renderer's `format:"number"` cell does `Number(value)` and prints the RAW
 * string only when that is NaN (`blocks/table.tsx`), so `"—"` and
 * `"0 · Out of stock"` survive verbatim, `"12"` renders as a number, and `""`
 * or a missing key would render as `0` — a zero nobody counted. The React tier
 * has no such constraint and renders the same string anyway: an operator
 * comparing the two screens must not have to work out whether two different
 * renderings mean the same thing.
 *
 * THREE INPUT CASES, NEVER FOLDED INTO EACH OTHER:
 *  - a number — a known count, `0` included;
 *  - `null` — the sku carries no inventory record, so the count is unknown for
 *    this row (and a row with no sku at all can have nothing else);
 *  - `undefined` — the response carried no stock figure at all (a service older
 *    than the on-hand projection, or one whose stock read degraded).
 *
 * A missing `threshold` costs the `Low` band and nothing else: a count still
 * renders and `0` still reads `Out of stock`, neither of which needs one.
