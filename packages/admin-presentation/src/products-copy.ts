/**
 * The Pricing & inventory screen's authored copy — the strings BOTH Pricing &
 * inventory screens put on screen (INC-21).
 *
 * WHY A SCREEN'S COPY IS IN A SHARED PACKAGE AT ALL. The same reason
 * `orders-copy.ts` gives, and it is a migration artefact in exactly the same
 * way: for the length of this migration there are TWO Pricing & inventory
 * screens rendering the same products side by side in the same sidebar, and
 * ADR-0014 requires both to keep working until the replacement is proven. That
 * makes every string here a cross-surface contract rather than a screen's
 * private business — an operator comparing the two, which is the entire point
 * of shipping them together, must not have to work out whether two different
 * sentences describe the same state.
 *
 * WHAT IS *NOT* HERE, AND WHY — the list is short on purpose, because after
 * INC-21's review the default is that a rendered string belongs here.
 *
 *  1. **Every outcome banner a WRITE produces** ("Stock added", "SKU already in
 *     use", "This product changed since you opened it", …). Those stay in
 *     `products-page.ts`, because the React screen does not author them — it
 *     forwards the click to the Block Kit handler and renders the notice that
 *     handler returned (ADR-0014's "no second implementation of a path that
 *     moves stock"). Copy only one surface can PRODUCE is not a cross-surface
 *     contract, and moving it here would suggest the React tier decides
 *     something about a stock movement. It decides nothing.
 *  2. **Strings only one surface has a place for.** The Block Kit screen's
 *     `Open product` picker label and its `Review removal` submit describe
 *     controls the React screen deleted (the picker) or collapsed (the staged
 *     review step); the React screen's `Loading product…` / `Loading products…`
 *     describe a state Block Kit cannot be in, since it re-renders the whole
 *     block tree per interaction. Sharing a string for a control the other
 *     surface does not have would assert a parity that does not exist.
 *  3. **Generic console chrome** — `Apply filters`, `Load more`, `Clear
 *     filters`. These are not this SCREEN's vocabulary; `Clear filters` already
 *     lives in `list-outcome.ts` with the ladder that offers it, and the other
 *     two belong beside it in whichever increment gives the console a shared
 *     list-chrome module. Duplicated across six screens today, so pulling two of
 *     them here would make this file the accidental home of a console-wide
 *     concern.
 *  4. **Wire values that happen to read as words** — `physical`, `digital`,
 *     `archived`, `any`. Those travel as DATA from the plugin
 *     (`PRODUCTS_STATUS_OPTIONS`, `PRODUCTS_KIND_OPTIONS`), which is the
 *     stronger guarantee: the console cannot offer an option the screen it is
 *     migrating from does not have, because it holds no copy of the list.
 *
 * WHEN THE BLOCK KIT SCREEN IS RETIRED, this module goes back to
 * `@otta-sh/admin-react` and stops being shared.

 * zero-row result means nothing in the catalog sits at or below the threshold —
 * a claim the screen can now keep, and the opposite of the page-scoped
 * narrowing this replaced.
 *
 * ONLY WHEN IT IS THE SOLE ACTIVE FILTER. The predicates are ANDed, so "low
 * stock + Archived", "low stock + Digital" and "low stock + a search" can each
 * return nothing while the catalog is full of low-stock products; this copy
 * would then blame the threshold for the other filter's work. A caller with a
 * second filter on renders {@link PRODUCTS_NO_MATCH} instead, which names the
 * filters rather than the stock — see `products-list.tsx`'s `noMatch` choice.
 *
 * WHAT "NOTHING IS LOW" MEANS, EXACTLY. Not "everything is above the
 * threshold": a product with no inventory row is neither low nor comparable to
 * it (`ProductSummary.onHand`'s null is unknown, never zero). Both sentences
 * below therefore say what the PREDICATE found — no row at or below the
 * threshold — rather than making a claim about every product's stock level.
 *
 * NO `scanNote` OF ITS OWN ANY MORE, and the deletion is the point. That field
 * exists for a screen with BETTER WORDS than the ladder's default, and this
 * screen had them only while the narrowing made a zero-row page with a cursor
 * behind it the ORDINARY case. It is now unreachable: the store emits a cursor
 * only when a page overflows its limit, so zero rows always means no cursor.
 * The ladder's default composes `emptyText` with the shared "Load more scans
 * further", which keeps the rung — and `Load more` with it — should a future
 * caller ever reach it, without this screen authoring a sentence nothing can
