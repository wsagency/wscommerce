/**
 * The admin console's ONE date dialect (INC-13).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The console had grown three answers to "what time did
 * this happen?" and they disagreed on screen:
 *
 *  - `fields` rendered the raw wire value — `2026-07-10T01:00:00Z` — under a
 *    label suffixed `(UTC)`. That is a machine's format printed at a human: an
 *    operator reading it has to parse a date out of punctuation, and cannot
 *    compare it at a glance to anything else on the page.
 *  - Table columns rendered `relative_time` ("3 weeks ago"), which the ORDER
 *    DETAIL then restated as an absolute instant — so the same field, `Placed`,
 *    read as two different things one click apart.
 *  - Two screens had each independently grown a date formatter
 *    (`orders-page.ts`'s `HEADER_DATE`/`headerDate` and `reports-page.ts`'s
 *    `DATE_LOCALE`/`formatDay`) plus a private copy of the same three day
 *    helpers. Same Intl options, same UTC pinning, same locale chosen for the
 *    same reason, written twice by accident. Each carried a comment pointing at
 *    the other and naming this module as the absorber.
 *
 * This module is that absorber. Everything the console renders as a date or a
 * timestamp comes from here, so a change to the dialect is one edit and cannot
 * land on one screen only.
 *
 * THE FORMAT: `8 Jul 2026, 10:30 UTC`.
 *
 *  - DAY-MONTH-YEAR, spelled month. `8 Jul 2026` cannot be misread the way a
 *    numeric `7/8/2026` can — the ambiguity is not a nit when the value decides
 *    whether an order is inside a refund window. `en-GB` is the locale for that
 *    SHAPE, not for its country.
 *  - MINUTES, never seconds. Seconds are noise on every surface here (M-6 said
 *    as much when it asked for ISO trimmed to seconds; a human-readable
 *    rendering can go one step further), and `hourCycle: "h23"` keeps midnight
 *    as `00:00` rather than a locale-dependent `24:00`.
 *  - THE ZONE IS PART OF THE VALUE, not of the label. It comes from Intl's own
 *    `timeZoneName`, which is why the `(UTC)` suffix that every one of these
 *    labels used to carry is gone: ICU writes the zone itself and the label goes
 *    back to naming the event (`Placed`, `Shipped`, `Cancelled`). The gain is
 *    that the zone is now one more thing {@link DATE_LOCALE} governs instead of
 *    English hard-coded into seven label strings — see the localization note.
 *  - UTC-PINNED, ALWAYS (M-6). No surface in this console converts a timestamp
 *    to a local zone. A value carrying an offset (`…+05:00`) is formatted as
 *    the instant it denotes, in UTC — which is a rendering, not a conversion,
 *    and is strictly better than the old pass-through that put a non-UTC offset
 *    on screen for X-13 to flag.
 *
 * LOCALIZATION. The optional viewer locale renders English with `en-GB` and
 * Croatian with `hr-HR`. English remains the default for existing consumers.
 * Both languages keep the same UTC instant and minute precision; Intl supplies
 * translated month names, separators and the zone label.
 *
 * BIDI — what is NOT delivered. This module does not wrap its output in
 * `U+2068 FSI` / `U+2069 PDI`. ICU bidi-balances WITHIN the string it returns,
 * but a formatted timestamp is composed into surrounding text at several call
 * sites (a `fields` value beside its label; a banner sentence such as
 * `Deleted on <value>. It cannot be edited…`), and on an RTL page such a
 * composition can reorder the LTR run against the surrounding text at the seam.
 * Isolating it is a console-wide decision — every value composed into a label
 * has the same exposure, not just dates — and it is a recorded follow-up, not
 * something this module should solve locally with a bespoke wrapper only dates
 * get.
 *
 * IO-FREE — pure `Intl` + string work, safe inside the workerd sandbox (G7).
