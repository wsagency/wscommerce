/**
 * The gateway-agnostic settlement use-case (§5): **verify → dedupe → transition →
 * commit-or-grant**. Both Stripe (webhook bytes) and x402 (page-gate proof)
 * converge here.
 *
 * 1. `gateway.verifyConfirmation(raw)` — a reject (bad signature / unknown /
 *    malformed) is a typed failure (HTTP 400). All crypto is adapter-side.
 * 2. Record the delivery in `payment_events` (UNIQUE `dedupeKey` — the audit
 *    trail). **A duplicate OF THE SAME ORDER does NOT short-circuit**: every
 *    delivery re-DRIVES the
 *    idempotent, state-guarded steps below, so a crash between any two of them
 *    (dedupe→flip, flip→commit/grant) is healed by the next gateway retry — the
 *    Phase-3 claim/resume idiom. "Settles once" is enforced by the guarded
 *    `pending → paid` flip, the `provider_ref`-keyed payment record, the
 *    state-guarded `commit`, and the grant-once entitlement key — never by
 *    blind-trusting the dedupe row.
 * 2b. A duplicate whose recorded row names a **different** order is the opposite
 *    case and is TERMINAL (`RECEIPT_REBOUND` + anomaly, nothing moved): one
 *    settlement consumes one payment. This is the tx-hash binding
 *    `@otta-sh/payments-x402`'s header calls load-bearing — `proof.orderId` is
 *    never on-chain-attestable, so the amount equality in step 3 is not on its
 *    own enough to stop one receipt from settling a second, same-priced order.
 * 3. Amount + currency MUST equal `order_totals.total` — mismatch ⇒ reject +
 *    record anomaly (§9 Risk 3); no auto-refund. Checked only while the order
 *    can still settle: a terminal order short-circuits FIRST (review G6), so a
 *    stray mismatched duplicate on an already-paid order is a plain no-op, not
 *    a false anomaly.
 * 4. Guarded `pending → paid`; record the `payments` row; per line: physical ⇒
 *    `commit(reservationId)` (a lost adopted hold is the loud 0-row anomaly, §5);
 *    digital ⇒ grant entitlement (grant-once). An already-`paid` order re-drives
 *    the side-effects idempotently and no-ops.
 * 5. **Losing the `pending → paid` flip mid-flight** (an expiry/cancellation raced the
 *    settle between load and flip) is exactly as LOUD as finding the order
 *    already terminal: `PAID_FLIP_LOST` anomaly + manual-reconciliation flag —
 *    money was captured while stock was released; never a silent no-op.
 *
 * A verified `failed` event (`payment_intent.payment_failed`) is INFORMATIONAL
 * (ADR-0022): it is recorded by step 2 — deduped, bound to its order, auditable —
 * and changes nothing else. The order stays `pending` with its stock held and its
 * coupon consumed, because the PaymentIntent is still payable after a decline and
 * the pay page retries on it; failing the order here is what turned a decline
 * followed by a successful retry into `PAID_FLIP_LOST`. If the buyer pays, the
 * `succeeded` event settles it normally; if nobody does, the order-expiry sweep
 * (`expireOrders`) releases the stock and the coupon when the hold lapses.
