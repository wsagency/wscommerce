 * **`pending` order row is durably inserted before any reservation is adopted**
 * (§5 ordering), so a partial-adoption abort is never a stranded hold: the abort
 * expires the order at once and releases what it adopted (and a crash before that
 * leaves it to `expireOrders`). Physical lines adopt their cart reservation via the guarded
 * `held → adopted` flip (moving it out of the Phase-3 sweep's scope); **digital
 * lines reserve nothing** (§6). All lines adopted ⇒ the cart flips `active →
 * checked_out` **and records the order's id** (secondary fence + issue #132) —
 * one statement, two columns, so a cart written THROUGH `checkout` (the
 * column's single writer) is `active` iff it carries no order id. That is a
 * writer-enforced invariant, not a structural one: no CHECK constraint backs
 * it, and a raw partial UPDATE can still produce a `checked_out` cart with a
 * NULL order id.
 * That stamp lands BEFORE the payment intent, so it says "this cart became that
 * order", never "that order was paid"; and because the idempotency
 * short-circuit returns earlier, a NULL cart `orderId` never proves the absence
 * of an order (`orders.cart_id` is the complete answer). Idempotent under
 * `idempotencyKey`: a replay returns the same order and re-snapshots nothing. A
 * replay of a still-`pending` order re-runs the adoption and the cart flip —
 * idempotent for this order (the guarded flips see the reservations already
 * `adopted` for it, and the cart already terminal) — so a call that threw
 * between the durable insert and either step is FINISHED by its retry, never
 * handed a payment intent over holds still on the cart's deadline. A replay is
 * the same key for the SAME cart: the key reused for a different cart is refused
 * `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED` (issue #133), both at the short-circuit and — for a
 * call that raced past it — after the deduped insert, before anything is adopted

/**
 * The post-insert steps of a checkout — adopt every physical hold, then flip the
 * cart — shared VERBATIM by the fresh path and the I1 replay of a `pending`
 * order, because a call can throw between the durable insert and either step and
 * the client's same-key retry must finish what it never reached. Both steps are
 * idempotent for the same order, so re-running them after a completed checkout
 * is a no-op.
 *
 * Three outcomes:
 *  - `finished` — every hold adopted for a still-`pending` order, cart flipped.
 *  - `left` — the order left `pending` underneath this call (a settle, the
 *    expiry sweep, a cancel, a concurrent same-key call's lost-hold flip).
 *    Whatever this call adopted for an order that no longer claims its holds is
 *    released again, an `expired` / `failed` order's coupon use is re-freed
 *    (idempotent; never for `cancelled` or `paid`), and no intent is minted. The
 *    cart is not stamped — unless the flip landed after the stamp, which the
 *    final re-check before returning `finished` catches.
 *  - `lost` — a hold is gone, so the order can never be paid. It is abandoned AT
 *    ONCE, exactly as the expiry sweep would abandon it (`pending → expired`,
 *    coupon use freed, then adopted holds released): the storefront's checkout
 *    key is fixed per cart, so an order left `pending` here would answer every
 *    later place from that cart RESERVATION_LOST until the sweep ran. Expired,
 *    the replay answers it as an order that has left the checkout window.
 *
 * Two concurrent same-key calls that both see the lost hold get different
 * answers — the flip winner RESERVATION_LOST, the loser `ok` with the expired
 * order and an empty, no-intent handle — and both are safe: neither can pay.
 *
 * `cartId` is the cart the order was made from (`null` only for an order with no
 * cart, which has nothing to fence). `releaseCoupon` is the caller's eager coupon
 * release on RESERVATION_LOST (the fresh path knows its redemption id; the replay
 * releases order-scoped).

	//    the loser's insert is deduped by `orders.idempotency_key` and its
	//    `order.id` is the WINNER's — that is the id the cart must record.
	//
	//    A `false` return is deliberately silent (a replay legitimately loses the
	//    flip). Note the stamp lands here, BEFORE `gateway.createIntent()`, so a
	//    stamped cart proves only "this cart became that order", never that the
	//    order was paid. And because a call can die between the order insert and
	//    this line (healed only when the same key is replayed), a NULL `orderId`
	//    does NOT prove no order exists — see the port's JSDoc; `orders.cart_id`
