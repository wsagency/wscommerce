 *     arbitration (`Σ active ≤ min(Σ captured, total)`) under the `orders` row
 *     lock and inserts a `reserved` row. A loser is rejected HERE — before any
 *     gateway call — so no interleaving can let money leave the provider only
 *     for the ledger to refuse it afterward.
 *  2. **Issue** at the gateway (Stripe pre-flight → `refunds.create`, our key as
 *     Stripe's native `Idempotency-Key`).
 *  3. **Settle the reservation** by the gateway outcome:
 *     - success   → `finalizeRefund` (stamps refundRef; flips `→ refunded` iff
 *                   the FINALIZED Σ reached the ceiling);
 *     - fail-closed / terminal / unsupported → `voidRefund` (nothing issued —
 *                   capacity released, audit row kept) — except a RESUMED
 *                   reservation whose pre-flight fails closed, which is held
 *                   `unverified` and flagged (its own earlier issue may be the
 *                   money the provider shows);
 *     - retryable → reservation KEPT (`reserved`): a same-key retry resumes it
 *                   (crash-heal: re-issues under the same provider key);
 *     - ambiguous → `markRefundUnverified` (capacity HELD — the safe direction —
 *                   until a human re-checks the provider).
 *
 * The MANUAL path (`refundable:false` — x402 / no Stripe secret) has no gateway
 * leg, so it stays the one-shot atomic `recordRefund` (insert finalized + flip),
 * which is reserve-and-finalize collapsed into one transaction.
 *
 * "Issued but unrecorded" is impossible by construction: issuance strictly
 * follows a committed reservation, and `finalizeRefund` updates that existing
 * row (it cannot lose arbitration — the capacity is already held). The residual
 * guard (a finalize that finds no row) records a `REFUND_UNRECORDED` anomaly
 * carrying the provider refundRef + flags reconciliation, and returns the
 * distinct `REFUND_ISSUED_UNRECORDED` — never a silent drop, never confusable
 * with a clean rejection.
