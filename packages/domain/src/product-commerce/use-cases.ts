/**
 * Thin IO-free orchestration over the `ProductCommerceStore` +
 * `InventoryStore` ports (Phase 1 §7/§8 Risk 4).
 *
 * Composes two ports: the commercial upsert itself, plus a create-if-absent
 * `InventoryStore.seedOnHand` write. The seed is attempted on EVERY save with
 * a known sku — deliberately NOT gated on "sku was just set" (review B1) and,
 * since PR 1a, not gated on a stock figure being supplied either: the two
 * writes are separate IO calls with no shared transaction, so a crash/fault
 * after the upsert commits but before the seed lands would otherwise strand a
 * durably-priced product with no inventory row forever. Because `seedOnHand`
 * is a single-statement `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (sku) DO NOTHING`
 * (contract-proven to never clobber an existing or already-decremented
 * `on_hand`), the always-attempt shape is safe AND self-healing: a retried
 * save re-attempts the seed and heals the stranding. On seed failure the error
 * propagates (the command fails, the caller retries) — never swallowed.
 *
 * PR 1a — the INVARIANT is "a product with a sku has an inventory row", held
 * by the data rather than by one caller, so an absent `initialOnHand` seeds
 * `0` rather than skipping: the integrator path (`PUT /products/:id/commerce`)
 * can no longer mint a sku with no inventory row, which is what made
 * `POST /admin/products/:id/restock` a permanent NO_INVENTORY_ROW 409.
 * CONSEQUENCE, deliberate: because the seed is create-if-absent, once a row
 * exists a LATER save's `initialOnHand` is a no-op — the create-only Stock
 * figure only ever lands on the save that first carries the sku. Adding stock
 * after that is `restock`'s job (which now always has a row to add to).

 * carries the guard semantics (replay dedupe, not_found, stale, currency
 * integrity). Exists so the plugin's route/client layer composes a use-case,
 * not a store method, like its siblings.
 *
 * Validation (throws `InvalidProductFieldError`, mapped to 400 upstream):
 *  - `price.amount` must be STRICTLY POSITIVE — a $0 commerce price is not a
 *    valid edit (branded `Cents` already rejects negatives/floats; ">0" is the
 *    one rule left to the domain). `compareAtPrice`/`unitCost` are NOT held to
 *    ">0" (a $0 compare-at / cost is a meaningful "cleared to zero"; branded
 *    `Cents` still rejects negatives/floats). `compareAtPrice >= price` is
 *    deliberately allowed (see the port's `UpdateProductCommerceFieldsInput`).
 *  - WITHIN-EDIT currency consistency: every money field SUPPLIED in a single
 *    edit (`price`, `compareAtPrice`, `unitCost`) must share ONE currency. This
 *    is a pure client-shape rule (independent of stored state), so a mixed-
 *    currency edit is rejected atomically here as a 400 — never partially
 *    applied — BEFORE the store's stored-vs-new `currency_mismatch` guard runs.
 *    A cleared field (`null`) carries no currency and is exempt.
 *  - `weightGrams` / `lengthMm` / `widthMm` / `heightMm`, when provided
 *    non-null, must be non-negative safe integers.
 * NOT re-checked here: stored-currency integrity + existence + staleness are the
 * STORE's atomic concern (checking them here would be a TOCTOU race the CAS
 * already closes); SKU live-uniqueness stays the store's partial-index guard.
 *
 * PR 1a — after an `ok`, this ALSO seeds a create-if-absent inventory row for
 * the resulting `sku` at `0`, so the invariant "a product with a sku has an
 * inventory row" holds on the ADMIN write path too (before 1a, the console was
 * able to set the first sku with nothing ever creating the row, and
 * `POST /admin/products/:id/restock` 409'd NO_INVENTORY_ROW forever). It takes
 * `ProductCommerceDeps` rather than a bare store for that reason. Always-
 * attempt, never gated on "the sku changed" — the same B1 reasoning as
 * `upsertProductCommerce`: two IO calls, no shared transaction.
 *
 * WHY THAT IS SAFE HERE, given this is a CAS and not an upsert. If the guarded
 * UPDATE commits and the seed then throws, `updatedAt` has already moved, so a
 * naive retry would be `stale` and the product would be stranded with a sku and
 * no inventory row. It self-heals through a three-link chain — the whole safety
 * argument, so do not reorder any of it without re-reading this:
 *  1. When the guarded UPDATE matches zero rows, every adapter classifies the
 *     no-op in ONE fixed order — not_found → REPLAY → stale → currency_mismatch
 *     (pinned by the port doc on `ProductCommerceStore.updateCommerceFields`
 *     and by the contract suite on both dialects).
 *  2. So a SAME-KEY retry takes the replay branch and returns `ok` carrying the
 *     stored row, AHEAD of the staleness check — and the always-attempt seed
 *     below then runs again and lands.
 *  3. And a retry of the same submission IS same-key: the admin plugin derives
 *     its `Idempotency-Key` from the wire's content and sends it; a client that
 *     sends no header gets the service's deterministic per-submission fallback.
 * That replay branch models a DOUBLE-SUBMIT or a transport-level retry of the
 * byte-identical request. It is NOT the merchant clicking Save again — that
 * reloads the fresh detail first, so it carries a new `expectedUpdatedAt` and
 * hence a new key, and heals through the ordinary CAS path instead. Both routes
 * heal; the tests name and pin each one separately.
 *
 * A SKU RENAME IS NOT THIS FUNCTION'S BUSINESS, and that is deliberate. When an
 * edit CHANGES the sku, the store carries that sku's on-hand row onto the new
 * one inside its own transaction (THE SKU-RENAME RULE on `ProductCommerceStore`
 * — carry, retain the source zeroed, or refuse with `SkuStockConflictError`),
 * because only the store can make the movement atomic with the row write; this
 * use-case composes two ports over two IO calls and could only ever leave a
 * half-done rename behind. The seed below therefore stays exactly what it was:
 * UNCONDITIONAL on every `ok`, never gated on "the sku changed". It runs after
 * a rename too, where the row it would create already exists holding the
 * carried units, so create-if-absent makes it the no-op it always was — the
 * always-attempt heal path is preserved, and the carried count is never
 * clobbered back to zero. A refusal propagates: the store threw, nothing was
 * written on either side, and no seed is attempted.
