	 * The operator's free-text lookup: an order-id PREFIX, **or** a folded
	 * `buyer_ref` PREFIX, **or** an EXACT purchase-time line sku, ORed, with
	 * `lower()` applied to BOTH sides of all three arms. Spelled in SQL — as the
	 * FLOOR, not as any adapter's emitted statement — that is `lower(id) LIKE
	 * lower(:s || '%')` OR `lower(buyer_ref) LIKE lower(:s || '%')` OR `EXISTS
	 * (SELECT id FROM order_items WHERE order_id = orders.id AND lower(sku) =
	 * lower(:s))`. No shipped adapter emits exactly that: the SQL stores emit the
	 * unanchored `lower('%' || :s || '%')` on the buyer-reference arm (their
	 * sanctioned superset, below), and a document store emits no SQL at all. The
	 * spelling is here because a predicate is clearer as a predicate than as prose.
	 *
	 * THAT IS A FLOOR, NOT A CEILING — the ratified narrowing (ADR-0019 §6). The
	 * contract suite GUARANTEES exactly this much of every adapter: a PREFIX of the
	 * id matches, a PREFIX of the folded buyer reference matches, an EXACT folded
	 * line sku matches, and `%`, `_` and `\` in the search string are compared as
	 * characters rather than as pattern syntax. Both text arms are therefore
	 * ANCHORED. An adapter MAY match MORE — a store whose SQL can serve an
	 * unanchored `LIKE` keeps the buyer-reference arm as a SUBSTRING, a superset of
	 * the guarantee — so the contract deliberately does NOT assert that a
	 * mid-string fragment fails; an adapter whose filter algebra has no substring
	 * operator serves the prefix and pins its own narrower behaviour in its own
	 * package tests. Callers may rely on the floor only. The narrowing is
	 * user-visible on the buyer-reference axis (a domain-only fragment stops being
	 * a search) and belongs in the screen's empty state, not only here.
	 *
	 * WHY A PREFIX ON THE ID. The console never renders a full uuid — it renders
	 * the shortest unique prefix (the git-style short id in
	 * `admin-presentation`'s `shortIdsFor`/`shortIdFixed`). The characters an
	 * operator can actually see, read out and type back are therefore a PREFIX,
	 * and an exact-only match made the one identifier on screen unsearchable. A
	 * whole id is its own prefix, so the previous exact-match behaviour survives
	 * as a special case. The id half is ANCHORED on purpose: an unanchored id
	 * match would surface arbitrary rows on any hex fragment.
	 *
	 * WHY A PREFIX ON THE BUYER REF, RATHER THAN AN EXACT MATCH. It holds the
	 * customer's email, and an operator arrives with what they can read off a
	 * ticket — usually the start of the address — not the address exactly as
	 * stored. A whole address is its own prefix, so the exact lookup survives as a
	 * special case, exactly as it does on the id arm. Anchored rather than
	 * unanchored because the guarantee has to sit where EVERY store can meet it.
	 *
	 * WHY THE SKU HALF READS THE ORDER'S OWN LINES, AND IS EXACT. The sku matched
	 * is the one FROZEN onto the order's lines at purchase time — the same
	 * insert-once snapshot the detail screen renders — never the live catalogue's
	 * current sku for that product. Renaming a product's sku therefore leaves
	 * every earlier order findable under the sku it was bought as, and moves none
	 * of them to the new one; that is the point of the snapshot, and the contract
	 * pins it. The half is EXACT (folded, but no prefix, no substring) because a
	 * sku is an IDENTIFIER an operator pastes whole off a packing slip or a
	 * support ticket, and because exactness is the settled house rule for skus:
	 * `ProductListFilter.search` matches an exact-lower sku beside its substring
	 * title, and the `customer` key below keeps exact-lower `buyer_ref` for the
	 * same identity reason. A substring here would drag every variant of a family
	 * (`TEE-BLK-S`, `TEE-BLK-M`, …) into a search for one of them, which is a
	 * different question from the one the operator asked.
	 *
	 * ONE ROW PER ORDER, WHATEVER THE SKU ARM MATCHES — and that is the INVARIANT,
	 * not a mechanism. Lines are 1:N against the order; the list's contract is one
	 * row per order (`listOrders` doc) and `countOrders` shares the predicate, so an
	 * order carrying two matching lines must appear ONCE and count ONCE. Returning
	 * it twice would inflate the `limit + 1` next-page probe, shrink the page and
	 * make the count disagree with the caption it writes. HOW each adapter reaches
	 * that is its own business: the SQL adapters express the arm as a correlated
	 * `EXISTS` and never as a join onto `order_items` (a join is exactly the shape
	 * that double-counts), the in-memory fake as `lines.some(...)`, and a document
	 * store as a denormalized per-`(sku, order)` key whose id makes uniqueness
	 * tautological. The contract pins the invariant on all of them.
	 *
	 * WHY THE FOLD IS EXPLICIT ON BOTH SIDES. A bare `LIKE` is case-SENSITIVE on
	 * Postgres and ASCII-case-INSENSITIVE on SQLite; only an explicit `lower()`
	 * on both operands makes the two dialects and the fake agree. The pattern
	 * side is folded by SQL `lower()` rather than JS `toLowerCase()` — one
	 * function folds both operands, so within a dialect the two sides cannot
	 * drift. Known, accepted divergence (the same one `couponFilterConditions`
	 * and `linkGuestOrders` already carry): SQLite's built-in `lower()` folds
	 * ASCII only, while JS `toLowerCase()` is Unicode-aware, so a non-ASCII
	 * buyer_ref ("JOSÉ@…") folds differently on sqlite than on pg/the fake.
	 * Emails and hex ids are ASCII, which is why this is accepted rather than
	 * solved. Ids are lowercase hex (`crypto.randomUUID()`), so folding the id is
	 * a no-op on the STORED side — it is there to forgive the TYPED side, e.g. a
	 * uuid pasted back from a client that upper-cased it. The sku half folds the
	 * same way and inherits the same caveat: it spells `lower(sku) = lower(:s)`
	 * (SQL folding both operands) rather than the products list's `lower(sku) =
	 * :sJsLowered` — identical for the ASCII skus a catalogue actually carries,
	 * and one fewer place the two sides can drift apart within a dialect.
	 *
	 * WILDCARDS ARE LITERAL. `%`, `_` and `\` (the escape character itself) are
	 * `LIKE` metacharacters; a search containing them matches them as characters
	 * (the SQL adapters escape the pattern and pass `ESCAPE '\'`; the fake and a
	 * document store build no `LIKE` pattern at all, so their `startsWith`/
	 * `includes` are literal by construction). The
	 * sku half needs no escaping at all — an equality has no pattern language, so
	 * a sku spelled `50%_OFF` is compared character for character.
	 *
	 * THE EMPTY STRING MATCHES EVERYTHING, because every string starts with `""`
	 * (and, on an adapter serving the wider arm, contains it). That is the widest
	 * filter this axis has, not the narrowest — the inverted reading of "search for
	 * nothing". (The sku half does
	 * not widen it further and does not narrow it: `""` equals no real sku, and
	 * the id arm has already matched every row.) The service's query schema
	 * requires `min(1)`, so the wire cannot send it; the boundary is pinned in the
	 * contract for every other caller.
	 *
	 * THE SEQUENTIAL SCAN IS THE DESIGN IN THE SQL ADAPTERS, not an oversight. The
	 * unanchored substring THEY serve as their superset of the buyer-reference arm
	 * cannot be served by a b-tree, so `idx_orders_buyer_ref_lower` (migration
	 * `0022`) no longer backs their predicate; nor can the primary key serve the
	 * anchored id half, since a default-collation b-tree answers
	 * `LIKE 'x%'` only with `text_pattern_ops`, and either way an OR arm that
	 * must scan forces a scan for the whole predicate. A trigram/full-text index
	 * was declined outright at this scale, and the shape of the cost was measured
	 * before deciding: over 5k rows, a page whose search matches NOTHING (the
	 * worst case — the whole table scanned, then sorted) took 3.4 ms, and one
	 * with matches dense enough for the `(created_at, id)` keyset index to keep
	 * driving the ordering took under 1 ms with the search riding as a heap
	 * filter. Read those as a FLOOR, not as the production statement: they came
	 * from a synthetic four-column `orders` table with no `order_totals` join and
	 * no other filter axis, and a searched page issues the list AND the exact
	 * filtered-set count together, so a real page pays this predicate twice under
	 * the same filter (see `countOrders`). They are not comparable
	 * to the products list's ~27 ms/page figure either — different table, columns
	 * and harness — which is why that number is cited only as the precedent for
	 * ACCEPTING an unanchored scan, never as a bound on this one. Revisit if
	 * orders reach a scale where the shape stops holding; measure the real
	 * statement then. The index still backs every EQUALITY path on `buyer_ref` —
	 * `linkGuestOrders` and the `customer` key below — which is exactly why those
	 * keep exact-lower-equals semantics and did NOT follow this widening.
	 *
	 * THE SKU ARM IS PLANNED DIFFERENTLY BY THE TWO DIALECTS, and neither shape
	 * was assumed — both were read off `EXPLAIN` of the statement the adapter
	 * actually compiles, over a synthetic 5k-order / 10k-line set (ANALYZEd).
	 *
	 * ON POSTGRES IT IS ONE MORE SCAN, of `order_items`, not a per-row probe. pg
	 * DE-CORRELATES the `EXISTS` into a hashed subplan: one pass over the line
	 * table filtered on `lower(sku)` — a sequential scan, since `lower(sku)` has
	 * no index — hashed by `order_id` and then probed in memory per row. That pass
	 * is paid by EVERY search, including one that is plainly an id or an email,
	 * and by BOTH statements a searched page issues. Measured (statement
	 * `Execution Time`, pg 16): a sku search 6.3 ms for the page and 5.9 ms for
	 * its count, against 2.8 ms and 2.8 ms for the same search with the arm
	 * stripped out; an id-PREFIX search 5.4 ms and 5.6 ms, against 4.2 ms and
	 * 2.7 ms without it. Forcing the intuitive plan instead (`enable_seqscan =
	 * off`, which does make the probe an index scan on
	 * `idx_order_items_order_product`, 5000 loops) was SLOWER — 21–24 ms across
	 * runs — so that index is not what keeps this cheap on pg; the hash is.
	 *
	 * ON SQLITE IT IS THE OPPOSITE, and that is fine. SQLite keeps the subquery
	 * CORRELATED and serves it as a per-row `SEARCH order_items USING INDEX
	 * idx_order_items_order_product (order_id=?)`, so there the arm rides the very
	 * index the pg plan ignores; and because SQL's `OR` short-circuits and the two
	 * cheap arms are written FIRST, a row already matched by id or buyer_ref never
	 * runs the probe at all. Measured there (mean of 5 store calls,
	 * better-sqlite3): 4.4 ms for an id-prefix page against 5.2 ms for a sku page.
	 *
	 * Read all of these as a SHAPE, not a budget, for the same reasons the figures
	 * above are a floor. The obvious lever, if the shape stops holding on pg, is a
	 * functional index on `lower(order_items.sku)`, which turns that one scan into
	 * an index scan; deliberately not pulled now, on the same reasoning that
	 * declined the trigram index — measure the real statement first.
