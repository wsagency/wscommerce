	// stock", because the list renders a per-row stock cell where inventing a
	// zero would invent an out-of-stock claim for every never-synced product.
	// This method cannot make that distinction: its return type is `number`,

	// caller. Do NOT "harmonize" the two by making the list coerce `null → 0`
	// — that erases a fact the list is specifically there to show. Widening
	// THIS signature to `number | null` is the direction that preserves
	// information, and is a separate change with its own callers to audit.
	//
	// Deliberately NOT a batch/list method: it is a single-row read for the
	// ONE product a detail view opens. The admin list no longer needs it — it
	// carries `onHand` via a single LEFT JOIN inside `listProducts`'s own

	// WHY A SECOND METHOD RATHER THAN A WIDENED `getOnHand`. The warning above
	// says widening is "the direction that preserves information, and is a
