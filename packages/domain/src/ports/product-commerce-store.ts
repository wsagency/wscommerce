 * Filters for the admin Products list. All optional — an empty filter lists

 * than `OrderListFilter.states` (an OR-set): a product's `active` publish
 * gate and `productKind` are each a two-value axis, so a single-value
 * equality filter is the honest, minimal mirror rather than an over-general
 * array.
 *
 * `search` and `OrderListFilter.search` (an order-id PREFIX, a case-folded
 * `buyer_ref` PREFIX, or an exact case-folded purchase-time line SKU) have
 * converged on the shape they share. A `title` is free text a merchant partially
 * remembers, so it matches as a case-insensitive SUBSTRING — WIDER than anything
 * the orders list guarantees, whose text arms are both anchored prefixes; and
 * `sku` is a structured identifier a
 * merchant quotes whole, so it stays an exact, case-insensitive match — which
 * is now the SAME rule the orders list applies to the sku frozen on an order
 * line, making `sku` the axis on which the two searches AGREE rather than the
 * one where they part. Neither takes the orders list's PREFIX treatment (a sku is
 * short and readable and renders in full, where an order uuid renders only as a
 * short prefix). The two lists still read that sku from different TABLES — this
 * one from the live catalogue row, the orders list from the purchase-time
 * snapshot on `order_items` — so a rename moves this list's rows and not that
 * one's. A row matches if EITHER half matches (never both required).

	 * Low-stock predicate parameter — the rule behind the admin console's "Low

	 * the store's SINGLE GLOBAL scalar
	 * (`SettingsStore.lowStockThreshold`), never a per-product reorder point —
	 * this store does not read settings itself; the CALLER resolves the
	 * threshold and passes the number through, exactly like every other value
	 * on this filter.
	 *
	 * DOMAIN: a NON-NEGATIVE INTEGER — mirrors the plugin's own boundary
	 * validation (`requireLowStockThreshold` in
	 * `in-process-admin-products-client.ts`, and its sibling bound in
	 * `in-process-reporting-settings-client.ts`), and the ONLY domain
	 * every adapter agrees on. A value outside it (fractional, negative,
	 * `NaN`, `±Infinity`) throws `InvalidLowStockThresholdError` — checked by
	 * EVERY adapter via the shared `isValidLowStockThreshold` guard, BEFORE
	 * any comparison or query runs — never a silent per-adapter answer: a raw
	 * fractional threshold applies cleanly in a naive fake/SQLite comparison
	 * but Postgres rejects it binding an `integer` column, and a raw `NaN`
	 * threshold would silently mean "everything passes" in a naive fake
	 * (`onHand > NaN` is always false) and "nothing passes" in SQLite — three
	 * different answers to one input, which is what the shared guard exists
	 * to make unreachable. Contract-pinned so the three can never drift apart.
	 *
	 * ALSO ENFORCED AT THIS FILTER'S OWN BOUNDARY:
	 * `in-process-admin-products-client.ts`'s list/count filter now runs
	 * `lowStockThreshold` through the same `requireLowStockThreshold` bound
	 * before it reaches this port, so a bad value is a typed input refusal
	 * rather than a 500.
	 *
	 * A row matches iff BOTH hold:
	 *  - its sku resolves to a KNOWN `inventory` row — the same LEFT JOIN
	 *    `ProductSummary.onHand` is sourced from. A product with NO inventory
	 *    row (or no sku at all — a "create then price" row) is UNKNOWN stock,
	 *    never "low": absent is not zero (see `ProductSummary.onHand`'s doc).
	 *    Folding the two would render every never-synced/unpriced sku as
	 *    artificially urgent.
	 *  - `on_hand <= lowStockThreshold` — INCLUSIVE, so a sku stocked exactly
	 *    at the threshold counts as low, and `on_hand === 0` ("out of stock",
	 *    a KNOWN fact) always matches a non-negative threshold.
	 *
	 * A SECOND, DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT "low stock" lives at
	 * `ReportingStore.lowStock(threshold)`: that report is INVENTORY-first (an
	 * orphan sku with no live product still lists, ordered by `on_hand`),
	 * while this filter is PRODUCT-first (a rowless product is excluded,
	 * ordered by `created_at`). Both happen to be inclusive at the boundary
	 * today, so the two agree there — but they are independent definitions
	 * with independent absent-row rules, and a future change to either one's
	 * boundary or absent-row decision must update BOTH docs, not just one.
	 *
	 * OMITTED (`undefined`) ⇒ no stock-based filtering — the unchanged
	 * default every existing caller keeps seeing. This is also the correct
	 * behavior when a caller cannot resolve a threshold at all (settings
	 * unset/unreadable) — never treat "no threshold" as "threshold 0" (which
	 * would silently return only out-of-stock rows instead of the honest
	 * "can't filter" answer).
	 *
	 * THIS ONLY MIRRORS HALF of the plugin's `filterUnavailable` degradation
	 * (`canFilter = threshold !== null && !unreadable`) — specifically the
	 * "no threshold to filter by" cause. It does NOT, and cannot, mirror the
	 * OTHER cause (`unreadable`: every row's `onHand` missing on the WIRE) —
	 * that is a client-side projection concern, orthogonal to whether this
	 * predicate ran. Once a caller wires this field up, a page can be
	 * genuinely, correctly filtered by real `on_hand` values while the
	 * client's OWN `onHand` display column is still unreadable: the two
	 * causes are independent axes post-wiring, not one merged concept.

 * refuse nothing. That is the same position the partial unique index occupies by
 * construction, so the two halves of the rule stay indistinguishable to a
 * caller. With no variant rows declared the check matches nothing, which is why
 * an unvarianted catalog behaves exactly as it did before.
 *
 * THE CURRENCY AXIS IS NOT SYMMETRIC ACROSS THE TWO PRODUCT-LEVEL WRITERS, and
 * that asymmetry predates variants. `updateCommerceFields` owns currency
 * integrity at product level and gains the reciprocal live-variant guard (its
 * clause 4c). `upsert` has never had a currency guard on ANY axis — it may
 * already switch an already-priced product's own currency silently, which is the
 * documented last-writer-wins stance of the integrator PUT and the CMS sync — so
 * bolting a variant-only currency refusal onto it would refuse the cross-ROW
 * case while still permitting the same-ROW case, in the same call. The sku axis
 * differs precisely because `upsert` DOES already refuse there
 * (`SkuConflictError` from the partial index), so extending that refusal across
 * the table is a widening of an existing rule rather than a new one. Giving
 * `upsert` a currency guard means giving it one on both axes at once, which is a
 * change to its own documented semantics and belongs to its own decision.
 *
 * THE SKU-RENAME RULE, shared by BOTH writers of `sku` (`upsert` and
 * `updateCommerceFields`) — a property of the COLUMN, not of one caller, so
 * neither writer may skip it. When a write changes a row's `sku` from one
 * non-null value to another, the adapter MUST, in the SAME transaction as the
 * product-row write:
 *  0. REFUSE while any LIVE (`held`/`adopted`) reservation still references the
 *     SOURCE sku — `SkuHeldStockError`, naming the sku and how many. A hold's
 *     units are already OUT of `on_hand`, so the carry cannot move them, and the
 *     hold cannot follow the rename (`reservations.sku` references
 *     `inventory.sku`, so it can be neither re-keyed nor deleted). Left alone,
 *     every later transition on that hold lands on the row the rename emptied: a
 *     release credits units back to a sku no product owns, and an upward adjust
 *     fails OUT_OF_STOCK against a zero the shopper cannot see. Every hold does
 *     end on its own — a cart hold expires on its deadline and the sweep
 *     releases it; an adopted hold resolves when its order does — but "ends on
 *     its own" is not "ends soon": an adopted hold lives as long as the order
 *     awaits payment, so a product with an order in flight can stay unrenameable
 *     for as long as that order does. Migrating the holds instead was rejected —
 *     see `SkuHeldStockError`.
 *  1. CLAIM the target sku's inventory row. If a row already exists there the
 *     whole write is REFUSED with `SkuStockConflictError` naming both skus —
 *     nothing is renamed, nothing moves. Occupied is occupied: the refusal does
 *     NOT depend on the quantity, because a row holding `0` is still a row
 *     ("known sku, out of stock" — a different fact from "no such sku") and may
 *     already be referenced by reservations and order lines. Merging the two
 *     counts would invent a stock figure, and picking a winner would discard
 *     one; the operator decides instead.
 *  2. CARRY the source sku's on-hand count onto the target. Without this a
 *     rename strands the units under a sku no product owns while the product
 *     starts again from zero — silent inventory loss with nothing on screen.
 *  3. RETAIN the source row, zeroed. A stock row is NEVER deleted and never
 *     re-keyed: `reservations.sku` references `inventory.sku`, so the rows a
 *     sold sku leaves behind are load-bearing history.
 * A write that changes nothing (same sku), applies nothing (a same-key replay,
 * a stale-watermark sync no-op, `not_found`, `stale`, `currency_mismatch`), or
 * sets the FIRST sku on a row that had none carries nothing — the carry follows
 * the ROW's before/after sku, never the input's. A source sku with no inventory
 * row has nothing to carry; the claimed target row simply stays at `0`, which
 * is the row `InventoryStore.seedOnHand` would have created a moment later
 * anyway (that always-attempt seed stays UNCONDITIONAL — the carry never turns
 * it into a conditional write; see `upsertProductCommerce` /
 * `updateProductCommerceFields`).
 *
 * THE FIRST-SKU ASYMMETRY, deliberate and pinned by the contract suite. Setting
 * the FIRST sku on a row that had none is NOT a rename, so none of the above
 * runs — and if that sku already has an inventory row, the product simply
 * ADOPTS it, units and all, where a rename onto the same row would have been
 * refused. This is the pre-existing seed/heal semantics, not a new decision:
 * `seedOnHand` is create-if-absent on the natural key, which is exactly how a
 * product re-linked to a sku it used to own gets its stock back after a failed
 * sync. Adoption is the ONLY way that heal can work, and there is no second
 * count to reconcile because the product had none. Renames refuse; first
 * assignment adopts. Changing it means designing the heal path a different way,
 * which is its own change.
 *
 * The same "there is no row yet" reasoning bounds what a CREATE can do: two
 * concurrent upserts that both create the SAME product with DIFFERENT skus
 * carry nothing either way, because neither finds a prior row to lock or a
 * prior sku to move from. The product ends on whichever write committed last,
 * with an empty inventory row under each sku that was named — no units exist to
 * strand, since a product only acquires them after it exists.
 *
 * WHAT THE CLAIM WAITS ON, because "it takes a lock" invites the wrong mental
 * model and the wrong worry. The claim waits only on a SAME-KEY speculative
 * insert: another transaction that has inserted the very same target sku and
 * not yet committed. It does NOT wait on a committed row (it conflicts and does
 * nothing), and the source lock waits on nothing at all when the source has no
 * row to lock. Crossed renames therefore cannot cycle — A→B and B→A claim
 * DIFFERENT keys, so neither ever waits on the other. Writes aimed at the SAME
 * target sku are the only ones that queue, and all but one of those is about to
 * be refused regardless.

	 *         within-edit currencies were already checked upstream

	 *         and required for the same reason it is: a product and its sizes are

	 *         holding another currency is refused rather than rendered. Without
	 *         this direction the guard is trivially bypassed by repricing the
	 *         product instead of the size. Resolved under the parent row's lock —
	 *         the same lock, in the same order, that the variant path takes — so
	 *         a product repricing and a variant pricing cannot both pass by
	 *         reading each other's "before" state. With no variants declared it
	 *         matches nothing and this guard cannot fire.

	 *    it since. An orphan cannot reclaim what was legitimately reused. This is
	 *    the ONE case where a sku goes back to null after being set: it is not an
	 *    edit clearing it (no writer can do that) but the row losing a claim it no
	 *    longer has, and the operator re-prices the size exactly as they would a
	 *    newly declared one.
	 *  - the stored `price` is CLEARED when its currency now conflicts with the
	 *    product's current currency (see `updateVariantFields` guard 4b for how
	 *    that currency is resolved) — the same integrity axis, and for the same
	 *    reason: a price the product can no longer honour is not a price.
	 * THE INVENTORY ROW IS NEVER TOUCHED by any of this. A kept sku keeps its
	 * units; a cleared sku leaves its `inventory` row exactly where it is, and
	 * re-assigning that sku later is governed unchanged by THE FIRST-SKU
	 * ASYMMETRY — a first sku ADOPTS the existing row, units and all, which is
	 * precisely how a variant re-linked to a sku it used to own gets its stock
	 * back.
	 *
	 * PRESENCE MOVES ONLY ON AN ORDERED, STRICTLY NEWER DELIVERY, and this is
	 * narrower than the title's own guard on purpose. The title is an unordered
	 * last-writer-wins cache, so a watermark-less save (a panel-style write) may
	 * update it. Presence is an axis with two OPPOSING transitions, so it needs
	 * the same treatment the publish gate gets: a resurrect applies only when the
	 * incoming `contentUpdatedAt` is present AND STRICTLY NEWER than the stored
	 * watermark (or the row has none yet). Two consequences, both load-bearing:
	 *  - a REDELIVERED watermark-less declare can never resurrect a variant a
	 *    newer save has since orphaned;
	 *  - a redelivered declare at an EQUAL watermark cannot resurrect either, so
	 *    the deactivate it raced with stays applied and a redelivery of THAT
	 *    command finds the row already orphaned and does nothing. Equal watermarks
	 *    across two different saves ARE possible where the CMS leaves `updatedAt`
	 *    frozen on a draft-only save (which is exactly why a resurrect needs the
	 *    strict comparison, and why re-declaring a key inside that window does not
	 *    take effect until the document is published), and one save can never both
	 *    declare and drop the same key.
	 * THE COST OF THE STRICT COMPARISON, so nobody has to discover it: re-sending
	 * the SAME save cannot repair an orphan that save caused in error, because its
	 * watermark is no longer strictly newer. The repair is a FRESH CMS save — any
	 * edit to the document, which bumps `updatedAt` and re-declares the key. That is
	 * the deliberate trade: a redelivery must never flip presence, so a redelivery
	 * cannot un-flip it either, and only a new decision by the CMS can.
	 *
	 * Rejects a missing/empty `productId` with `MissingProductIdError` and a
	 * missing/empty `variantKey` with `MissingVariantKeyError`, BEFORE any row is
	 * minted — the key is the identity, and an identity-less variant row could
	 * never be addressed again.
	 *
	 * NO PARENT-ROW CHECK, deliberately: a variant may land before its
	 * `product_commerce` row does (`content:afterSave` and the repeater's own
	 * delivery are independent fire-and-forget POSTs), exactly as `activate` may
	 * arrive before the row it publishes. Convergence is by the watermark, not by
	 * a foreign key that would abort instead.

	 * THE SKU-RENAME RULE BINDS THIS WRITER UNCHANGED, because it is a property

	 * products or variants, so a variant rename strands units exactly as a

	 * therefore not expressible here — it is a two-row movement and needs its own
	 * transactional verb.
