/**
 * The dependency boundary, executed rather than read.
 *
 * `sandbox-clean-guard.test.ts` is a TEXT SCAN over `src/` and stays that way —
 * it catches ambient globals (`fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`) that no import graph
 * can see. This file is its complement from the other side: it runs the REPO'S
 * OWN `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` — the same file `pnpm lint` cruises with, copied
 * verbatim, never a re-declaration of its rules — over a tiny tree of PLANTED
 * imports, and asserts on the NAME of the rule each one violates. A rule that
 * fires for the wrong reason, or a rule that silently stops matching (which is
 * exactly what the `^node:`-only builtin clause did for months), fails here.
 *
 * Why a generated tree instead of planting files in a real package `src/`: a fixture
 * under a real `src/` is a file `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm build`
 * would all pick up, and a forbidden import committed to the tree is the very
 * thing the rules exist to prevent. The tree is built in `os.tmpdir()` per run
 * and removed afterwards, so nothing forbidden ever exists inside the repo.
 *
 * How the tree resolves, and why that matters: the rules are written in TWO
 * spellings for every ban — a resolved `node_modules/...` path AND a bare
 * specifier left unresolved by pnpm's strict isolation — and the two halves
 * catch different things. Workspace packages here are reachable through
 * `node_modules/@otta-sh/<name>` symlinks into the fixture's own `packages/`,
 * which is how pnpm links them in the real repo, so enhanced-resolve follows
 * the symlink and dependency-cruiser reports the `^packages/<name>/` path the
 * third clause of each rule matches. `emdash` is a resolvable stub because the
 * `import type` allowance is expressed as `dependencyTypesNot: ["type-only"]`,
 * and an UNRESOLVED module is not tagged `type-only` at all — verified: with
 * `emdash` unresolved, the type-only case wrongly reports a violation. `pg` and
 * `node:fs` are deliberately left unresolved, which is what exercises the
 * bare-specifier half.
