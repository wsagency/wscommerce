/**
 * A2 (storefront-checkout plan §3) — the pure checkout view model.
 *
 * Two properties carry the whole design:
 *
 *  1. **Honest zeros.** `computeQuote` substitutes a synthetic zero-shipping
 *     method when no `methodId` is passed and skips the tax lookup entirely
 *     when no `zoneId` is passed, so a store with nothing configured gets
 *     `shippingCents: 0` / `taxCents: 0` on the wire. Rendering that as "Free
 *     shipping" or "Tax: $0.00" would be a promise the store has not made.
 *     Not-computed components render a LABEL, never a money string; a
 *     component that genuinely WAS computed renders its money even at zero.
 *
 *  2. **The idempotency key is stable per cart.** `checkout:${cartId}`,
 *     deterministic — a fresh key per render would mint a second order that
 *     the `CART_CHECKED_OUT` fence then rejects, stranding the buyer.
