/**
 * The declared collection set.
 *
 * It is assembled by spreading the adapter modules' own per-aggregate
 * declarations, and a spread has one failure mode worth pinning: if two modules
 * declared the same collection, one module's index list would silently win and the
 * loser's reads would fail at runtime on a field it believed it had declared — a
 * declared index being a read contract rather than a performance knob. So the
 * disjointness is asserted rather than assumed, by rebuilding the union the long
 * way and comparing counts.
