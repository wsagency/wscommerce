/**
 * The React console's Pricing & inventory data path, exercised INSIDE the
 * workerd sandbox (INC-21).
 *
 * WHY A SANDBOX SUITE AND NOT A UNIT TEST. ADR-0006 Decision 1 is the reason and
 * ADR-0014 reaffirms it verbatim: the workerd suites are the contract gate for
 * `@otta-sh/plugin`, and "a change that only works trusted is still broken".
 * This increment adds a branch to the plugin's single admin route, so that
 * branch is proven in the isolate the plugin is specified to run in — bundled
 * from a bare copy of `src/`, with no Node, no workspace resolution and no
 * `fetch` but the injected one.
 *
 * THERE IS NO SERVICE BEHIND THIS SCREEN ANY MORE (INC-D3a). `makeAdminClients`
 * builds `InProcessAdminProductsClient` and `InProcessReportingSettingsClient`
 * over `ctx.storage`, so the page, its count, its cursor and its threshold all
 * come off the plugin's own document store. Every assertion that used to read a
 * recorded request's QUERY STRING is therefore gone, and what replaces it is
 * strictly stronger: the fixtures are real rows, and a predicate is proven by
 * WHICH ROWS COME BACK rather than by the characters that were sent asking for
 * them. A query string can carry `lowStockThreshold=5` and still be applied to
 * the wrong column; a page that returns the `5` row and not the `6` row cannot.
 *
 * WHAT IT STILL COVERS, unchanged in substance:
 *
 *  1. **Raw values, never rendered ones.** A Block Kit row carries "$19.99"
 *     (money already spent, G1) and "42 · Low" (a band already decided). The
 *     React tier is fed minor units and a raw count, and formats both itself.
 *  2. **Resolving the threshold into a server-side predicate, and captioning it
 *     correctly.** "Low stock only" travels as a real filter axis, the count is
 *     taken under the SAME predicate, and the page's `total` therefore describes
 *     the rows above it.
 *  3. **The cursor as a predicate.** A continuation states its filters beside the
 *     token; a token that disagrees is refused and answered with page one,
 *     flagged.
 *
 * THE DEGRADED-SECONDARY ARMS ARE GONE WITH THE TRANSPORT THAT COULD PRODUCE
 * THEM, and each deletion is recorded where it used to stand. A settings read
 * that FAILS (`stock.threshold === null`, and with it every `filterUnavailable`
 * case), a tax-registry read that FAILS, and a page whose on-hand column came
 * back with no key at all (`stock.unreadable === true`) were all injected by
 * making a stub HTTP surface answer 404 or omit a field. In-process the settings
 * store answers from its own defaults rather than failing, `toProductSummaryWire`
 * always emits `onHand` as `number | null`, and `getTaxClasses` is a store scan.
 * A test that hand-built those states would be asserting against its own fixture,
 * not against this route — so the reachable half of each pair is kept and the
 * unreachable half is deleted with its reason.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, deliberately: the React components. Those are gated by
 * Playwright (`sites/staging/e2e/products-console.spec.ts`), which is additive
 * to this tier and replaces none of it.
 *
 * ONE STORE PER PROCESS (`storageBridge`), so every case addresses disjoint ids
 * and every list assertion narrows by a `search` term unique to its own case —
 * the catalogue is shared, the fixtures are not.
