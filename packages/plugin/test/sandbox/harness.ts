/**
 * Otta's own workerd-on-Node sandbox test harness (plan §6 step 1).
 *
 * Boots the REAL `workerd` binary (the public `workerd` npm package — not a
 * simulation, not Node `vm`/`worker_threads`) as a child process, loads
 * `src/sandbox-entry.ts` (bundled fresh per call via tsdown's programmatic
 * `build()`) as its worker module, and exposes `invokeHook`/`invokeRoute`
 * mirroring the wire shape em-dash's own `WorkerdSandboxedPlugin` uses
 * (`~/em-dash` `packages/workerd/src/sandbox/runner.ts` —
 * `POST /hook/<name>` / `POST /route/<name>`).
 *
 * `manifest.ts` is never mutated in `src/` — this harness copies the whole
 * `src/` tree into a scratch dir and overwrites ONLY the copy's
 * `manifest.ts` with the test's `allowedHosts` (and the in-process
 * `emailApiUrl`/`facilitatorUrl` egress) before bundling (plan §6 step 1 /
 * §8 Risk 5), so `pnpm build`'s real package output is never test-specific.
 *
 * `sandbox-storage.ts` is overwritten the same way when — and ONLY when — a boot
 * asks for storage (`storage: true`). The isolate cannot build a document store (it
 * is a database, and the isolate has no driver and must never acquire one), so the
 * store lives in this process and the copy's collections proxy to it over loopback.
 *
 * THAT IS OPT-IN, and the reason is a claim several suites make: with a single
 * baked `allowedHost`, the stub server's recorded requests ARE the plugin's entire
 * egress. The bridge's proxy calls `fetch` directly — it is the host's side of a
 * bridge, not plugin egress, so it is not subject to `allowedHosts` — and binding
 * it into every boot would quietly make that claim false. A suite that does not ask
 * for a document store therefore does not get one, and keeps a context byte-identical
 * to the one it always had.

 *
 * So such a boot derives its list from production's OWN resolver rather than

/**
 * Put every workspace package the plugin imports at runtime where the scratch copy

 * resolution walks the scratch directory's own `node_modules`, then
 * `/tmp/node_modules`, then `/node_modules`, and finds nothing: a bare
 * `@otta-sh/…` specifier would be left external by the bundler and workerd would
 * fail to load a module that imports a package it has no way to fetch.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A WEAKENING. What the bare copy pins is that the SHIPPED BUNDLE
 * IS SELF-CONTAINED. Materialising the packages here makes the specifiers
 * resolvable, and `noExternal` at the `build()` call makes tsdown INLINE them into
 * the single `.mjs` workerd loads — so the bundle stays exactly as self-contained
 * as before, and the suites still prove it by running.
 *
 * THE INLINING IS DECLARED, NOT INHERITED, and the first cut of this comment got
 * that wrong. It claimed the scratch tree "has no package.json declaring externals,
 * so tsdown inlines it" — but tsdown resolves its externals from the package.json
 * nearest the CWD, not the entry, and the CWD is the process's. From the repo root
 * that is a manifest with no `dependencies` and the inlining happened by accident;
 * from this package's own directory it is THIS manifest, where the workspace
 * packages are real dependencies, so tsdown left them external and every workerd
 * test failed to boot. Measured, both ways. The `noExternal` below states the
 * requirement instead of inheriting it, so the suites pass from any working
 * directory.
 *
 * ONLY `src/` IS COPIED, never a package's own `node_modules` (symlinks into the
 * pnpm store for tsdown/vitest/typescript, none of which belong in a worker
 * bundle's resolution graph), and the generated manifest points `exports` at the
 * TypeScript source — the same dev-time `exports` the real package.json declares.
