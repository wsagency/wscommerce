/**
 * The Orders WRITE path, exercised INSIDE the workerd sandbox (INC-R2).
 *
 * WHY A SANDBOX SUITE AND NOT A UNIT TEST. ADR-0006 Decision 1, reaffirmed by
 * ADR-0014 and again by ADR-0015: the workerd suites are the contract gate for
 * `@otta-sh/plugin`, and "a change that only works trusted is still broken". This
 * suite therefore drives the writes the way the React console does — one POST to
 * the plugin's single `admin` route, `type: "otta_console_act"`, an action id and
 * a flat payload — inside the isolate the plugin is specified to run in.
 *
 * WHAT IT REPLACES. `orders-page.sandbox.test.ts` was 4,035 lines, and the bulk of
 * it asserted the retired Block Kit screen's RENDERING: block order, accordion
 * keys and labels, which group `default_open` resolves to, table columns, picker
 * options, confirm dialogs, `context` wording, the `meter`, the `select` option
 * vocabularies, badge suppression, the fail-closed banner's shape. None of that
 * outlives the renderer. Everything asserting BEHAVIOUR moved here.
 *
 * THERE IS NO SERVICE BEHIND THESE WRITES ANY MORE (INC-D3a). The console's
 * clients come from `makeAdminClients(ctx)`, which composes the commerce
 * adapters straight over `ctx.storage` — so a write here is a write to a REAL
 * document store in the same isolate, and the state a refusal is compared
 * against is the state this file seeded through those same adapters. Every
 * assertion that used to read a recorded HTTP request (a POST body, an
 * `Idempotency-Key` header, an `X-Internal-Token`) is therefore gone: there is
 * no request to record, and no token — the token pair authenticated a caller TO
 * THE SERVICE, and ADR-0014 D3 deleted both with the deployment. What each write
 * DID is now read back off the order itself, which is the stronger statement
 * anyway: the old tests proved a request was addressed correctly, these prove
 * the order moved.
 *
 * ONE PROPERTY LOST ITS SUBJECT ON THIS TIER AND MOVED RATHER THAN BEING DROPPED.
 * F-2a's content-derived idempotency keys are still derived, exactly as before —
 * `admin-refund:<order>:<amount>:<watermark>` and the rest — but a key is now an
 * argument handed to a use-case inside this isolate instead of a header on a
 * wire, so no test AT THIS TIER can observe the STRING. The refund key's
 * derivation is therefore pinned one layer down, directly, in
 * `orders-refund-key.test.ts` — including F-2a's positive case, that two
 * deliberate identical refunds derive DIFFERENT keys because the observed
 * watermark moved. What the key BUYS is still observable here too: a replayed
 * note reads `Already added` (below), which is the dedupe the key performs.
 *
 * REFUNDS RUN ON TWO BOOTS. `makeAdminClients` composes the payment gateways
 * from kv exactly as checkout does (issue #303), so a refund's fate depends on
 * whether Stripe is configured. This file's MAIN boot provisions no Stripe
 * secrets: every well-formed refund there reaches the "no gateway is wired for
 * this order's method" arm and answers `409 REFUND_GATEWAY_UNAVAILABLE`, and the
 * refund cases on it cover everything IN FRONT of that arm — which is where
 * DA-3a and DA-3b live and where the money bugs are. The LAST describe boots a
 * second isolate with both Stripe secrets saved and `api.stripe.com` stubbed
 * (`helpers/stripe-api-stub.ts`), and drives the configured path end to end:
 * one `POST /v1/refunds` over `ctx.http` carrying the refund's idempotency key,
 * the success and fully-refunded notices, a double-submit that asks Stripe for
 * nothing more, and a ceiling refusal that never reaches Stripe.
 *
 * THE STALE-WATERMARK REFUSAL IS THE GATE (ADR-0015 Decision 3, as amended), and
 * it is proven on every write that carries a watermark: `THE REFUSAL — a refund
 * whose watermark no longer matches applies NOTHING` for the refund ledger,
 * `DA-3a: a cancel whose observed state no longer matches`, and `DA-3a: a
 * transition whose observed state no longer matches`. Its absent-watermark half —
 * refuse, do not re-read, do not tolerate — is `DA-3a is not opt-out` and the
 * unreadable-payload cases beside it.
 *
 * WHAT IS NO LONGER TESTED HERE, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A GAP. THREE checks went with
 * the deleted `-review` pair: the two further refusals ADR-0015 DECISION 3 names —
 * the DA-3c live-ceiling bound check and the unparseable-amount refusal — and the
 * `REFUND_BY_REQUIRED` attribution guard, which Decision 3 never named because it
 * was never one of its three. All three lived ONLY on `orders:refund-review`,
 * which no surface ever called; the ids and all three checks are deleted, so there
 * is no behaviour left for a test to pin. Refund attribution is now enforced on
 * the client alone — see ADR-0015's amendment, which records where that
 * enforcement has a hole. The reachable confirm's own money validation — integer
 * minor units, a positive amount, no float laundered into cents — is `M-3/B-2`
 * below and stays.
 *
 * A green happy path is not evidence for any of this, so every refusal test also
 * asserts the order is UNTOUCHED — read back through the same adapters.

/**
 * ADMIN REFUNDS WITH STRIPE CONFIGURED (issue #303), inside workerd.
 *
 * A SECOND BOOT, like `storefront-checkout.sandbox.test.ts`'s `place` suite: it
 * saves both Stripe secrets through the Settings form's own actions, grants
 * production's allowlist, and points workerd's global outbound at a local Stripe
 * API stub — so the refund passes the plugin's real `ctx.http` allowlist check
 * for `api.stripe.com` and then lands on the stub instead of the internet. The
 * main boot above stays secret-less, which is what keeps its fail-closed case
 * honest.
 *
 * The stub answers the two requests `StripePaymentGateway.refund` makes the way
 * Stripe does: the pre-flight `GET /v1/payment_intents/:id?expand[]=latest_charge`
 * reports the live refunded/captured view, and `POST /v1/refunds` refunds —
 * honouring Stripe's native idempotency (a repeated `Idempotency-Key` returns the
 * SAME refund and moves no more money). Orders are seeded through the same
 * adapters as above, with a succeeded capture whose `providerRef` is the
 * PaymentIntent the refund targets.
