/**
 * The Pricing & inventory WRITE path, exercised INSIDE the workerd sandbox
 * (INC-R3).
 *
 * WHY A SANDBOX SUITE AND NOT A UNIT TEST. ADR-0006 Decision 1, reaffirmed by
 * ADR-0014 and again by ADR-0015: the workerd suites are the contract gate for
 * `@otta-sh/plugin`, and "a change that only works trusted is still broken". This
 * suite therefore drives the writes the way the React console does — one POST to
 * the plugin's single `admin` route, `type: "otta_console_act"`, an action id and
 * a FLAT payload — inside the isolate the plugin is specified to run in.
 *
 * WHAT IT REPLACES. `products-page.sandbox.test.ts` was 2,170 lines, and the bulk
 * of it asserted the retired Block Kit screen's RENDERING: block order, the table's
 * columns, the filter accordion, the drill-in picker's option labels, which
 * accordion `default_open` resolves to, the three `block_id`s the staged/refused
 * remove-stock group cycles through, the identity strip's shape and evenness, the
 * tombstone and no-SKU context lines, accordion-label budgets and their truncation.
 * None of that outlives the renderer. Everything asserting BEHAVIOUR moved here.
 *
 * THERE IS NO SERVICE BEHIND THESE WRITES ANY MORE (INC-D3a). The console's
 * clients come from `makeAdminClients(ctx)`, which composes the commerce adapters
 * straight over `ctx.storage` — so a save here edits a REAL product-commerce
 * document and a stock movement moves a REAL inventory count, both in the same
 * document store this file seeds through those same adapters. Every assertion that
 * used to read a recorded HTTP request is therefore gone: there is no PATCH body
 * to inspect, no POST url to match, and no token pair to forward —
 * `X-Internal-Token`/`X-Service-Token` authenticated a caller TO THE SERVICE and
 * ADR-0014 D3 deleted both with the deployment. What each write DID is read back
 * off the product row instead, which is the stronger statement: the old tests
 * proved a request was addressed correctly, these prove the row changed — and, for
 * every refusal, that it did not.
 *
 * THE FOUR INVARIANTS THIS SCREEN'S GATE IS MADE OF, each proven below:
 *
 *  1. **Money is integer minor units, and absent is not zero.** A price is STORED
 *     as `{amount, currency}` in minor units or not at all; a malformed one is
 *     refused BEFORE anything is written; a blank compare-at is an explicit `null`
 *     CLEAR and never a zero; a blank price leaves the stored price alone and
 *     never becomes zero.
 *  2. **The stale-watermark refusal (DA-3a), carried verbatim.** A stock removal
 *     re-reads live stock and refuses on a mismatch with NOTHING written — and an
 *     ABSENT watermark refuses fail-closed, with no re-read at all. A save carries
 *     `expectedUpdatedAt` and refuses without one rather than clobbering; with a
 *     stale one it is refused by the store's own compare-and-set.
 *  3. **Idempotency without a nonce, and the replay case.** Every key is derived
 *     from content plus the watermark the operator saw. THE KEY IS NO LONGER A
 *     STRING ANY TEST CAN SEE — it is an argument handed to a use-case in this
 *     process rather than a header on a wire — so it is proven by what it BUYS:
 *     a double-submit of one rendered form applies once and still reads `Saved`
 *     (a second, distinct write against that now-stale watermark is refused as
 *     stale instead), and two deliberate movements taken against two different
 *     observed counts both apply.
 *  4. **The verified sparse edit.** Each of the three split saves writes its own
 *     fields and leaves every other stored value untouched, and `title`/`active`
 *     can never be written at all (G2 / ADR-0013) however hostile the payload is —
 *     neither `ProductEditWire` nor `UpdateProductCommerceFieldsInput` has a
 *     member for either.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT TESTED HERE, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A SILENT GAP.
 *
 * `products:remove-stock-review` — DA-3 state 1 → state 2 — is not ported. It
 * staged a quantity server-side so a SECOND RENDER could draw a confirm button;
 * React shows the dialog over the values the operator just typed, which is why the
 * console's gate has excluded that id since INC-21 and why nothing reachable has
 * ever called it. One check lived only on that step and therefore never ran for
 * any surface that shipped: the DA-3c bound of `qty` against the on-hand just
 * re-read. An over-removal is refused by the DOMAIN's guarded decrement instead,
 * which is asserted below. See ADR-0015, and `products-actions.ts`'s header.
 *
 * THE DEGRADED-OPERAND CASES ARE GONE WITH THE WIRE THAT COULD PRODUCE THEM. The
 * retired suite pinned five sentences composed from a rename refusal whose
 * operands the SERVICE had failed to send (`SKU_HELD_STOCK` with no `sku`, with a
 * non-numeric `liveHolds`, `SKU_STOCK_CONFLICT` with no `toSku`, …), each reached
 * by stubbing a malformed 409 body. In-process there is no body: the operands come
 * off typed domain errors — `SkuStockConflictError` carries both skus by
 * construction, `SkuHeldStockError` a positive integer count — and
 * `InProcessAdminProductsClient` normalises that count before this module sees it.
 * The fallback branches remain in `products-actions.ts` as defence, deliberately;
 * a test that hand-built the refusal to reach them would be asserting its own
 * fixture rather than this tier. The two REACHABLE rename refusals are pinned
 * whole, below.
 *
 * A green happy path is not evidence for any of this, so every refusal test also
 * reads the product back and asserts NOTHING was written.
