/**
 * `commerceClientContract` — the transport-agnostic client contract (work order
 * 02, INC-A7 / D6 / D7 tier T5).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The behavioural spec of the commerce client surface. Every case
 * here is shaped as *arrange backend state* → *call a client method* → *assert
 * the returned value or the typed rejection*. Nothing in this file knows how the
 * call travels: no URLs, no headers, no status codes, no request recording.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS, AND WHY IT OUTLIVED ITS OCCASION. It was lifted out of the HTTP
 * client's own test files so the in-process client could be proved behaviourally
 * identical BEFORE the HTTP one was deleted — a spec only one transport can
 * execute cannot do that. INC-D3b has now deleted the HTTP tier, so the
 * in-process tier is the only one left and
 * `commerce-client-contract.in-process.test.ts` is the only file that runs this.
 * The spec stays separate from that runner anyway: it is the port's behavioural
 * contract, and keeping it free of any one implementation's construction detail
 * is what would let a second implementation be held to it again.
 *
 * THREE SLICES, one per increment that consumed it:
 *   - `storefrontCommerceClientContract`       → INC-B10a (`CommerceClient`)
 *   - `adminOrdersProductsClientContract`      → INC-B10b (orders + products)
 *   - `adminRulesReportingClientContract`      → INC-B10c (rules + reporting)
 *
 * ASYNC REJECTIONS ONLY. Most failures here are typed RESULT VALUES
 * (`{ ok: false, reason }`) and are asserted as values. Where the port declares no
 * typed result — a malformed input — the failure is asserted as an AWAITED
 * REJECTION and never as a synchronous `throw`, so an implementation that refuses
 * before it does any work and one that cannot refuse before a round trip behave
 * alike under the same case. No case anywhere in this file asserts a status code,
 * in either direction; see `expectRejectedInput` for the one asymmetry that
 * follows from that and how it is handled.
 *
 * MONEY. Every amount in this file is an integer in minor units with an
 * explicit ISO-4217 currency, as the port requires.

 * What a tier's admin composition hands back.

 * the contract knows about, and the optionality is how it says so out loud.
 *
 * `orders` (INC-B10b-ii), `rules` (INC-B10c-i) and `reporting` (INC-B10c-ii) ARE
 * ALL FOLDED IN NOW and are still typed optional, which is
 * deliberate: each is read through `requireSurface` — the `rules` idiom — so a tier
 * that binds the slice without an orders surface fails LOUDLY at bind time,
 * naming itself and the surface, rather than being unable to express the gap at
 * all. `products` is the one non-optional member because the slice reads it in
 * its own `beforeAll` before any case runs.
 *
 * THE ALTERNATIVE WAS A STUB — an empty `listOrders`, an empty `listCoupons`, a
 * zeroed `getRevenue` — and a stub would make those slices PASS against an
 * implementation that does nothing. A green suite asserting the absence of
 * behaviour is worse than a missing one, because it is indistinguishable from
 * evidence. An absent surface makes its slice fail loudly instead
 * (`requireSurface`), so the gap shows up in a test report and closes by wiring,
 * never by softening a case.

// WHICH SEEDING PATH. A case whose SUBJECT is a write method calls that method
// directly — `upsertProductCommerce`, `createCart` and `addCartLine` are under
// test in their own cases and must not be hidden behind `arrange`. A case that
// merely NEEDS a product or a cart to exist uses `tier.arrange.*`, so a tier
// with a cheaper way to seed state can take it.
//
// ORDERING AND `reset()`. Every case below addresses disjoint product ids, skus,
// cart ids, rule ids and idempotency keys, which is the only reason a tier may
// implement `reset()` as a no-op. No case may depend on state another case left
// behind. The first real `reset()` lands with the in-process tier at INC-B10a.
//
// TIME. The lifted cases control it only by passing explicit `contentUpdatedAt` /
// `expectedUpdatedAt` watermark ARGUMENTS, which are inputs to the port and
// travel with the cases. Exactly ONE case needs more than that — the elapsed
// hold — and it takes it through the OPTIONAL `clock` hook rather than by
// sleeping, so a tier that cannot move its clock skips that one case and runs
// every other. No case asserts a generated id.
//
// TWO OPTIONAL HOOKS, AND WHY OPTIONAL IS NOT A LOOPHOLE. `clock` and `payments`
// gate only the cases whose subject needs them — a movable clock, a composed
// payment gateway — and the in-process tier offers both, so nothing it runs is
// excused from the shared spec. A gated
// case states its gate in its own NAME, so a test report says which tier skipped
// what and why without anyone reading this file. Every other case runs on every
// tier, unchanged: the moment a tier is allowed to narrow, reorder or soften one,
// the equivalence this contract exists to prove is gone.

		// Everything above was LIFTED from the HTTP client's own suites, so it
		// was already proven on one transport before it was shared. Everything
		// below was proven on ONE transport only — or on neither — and is moved
		// here so both run it. That is the whole of the equivalence proof: a
		// surface that only one implementation's suite ever touched is a surface
		// where the two may already disagree and nobody would know.
		//
		// TWO CASES ARE GATED, in opposite directions, and each names its reason
		// in its own title so a test report says why rather than a comment:
		//  - the elapsed-deadline case needs `tier.clock`, which a shared,
		//    long-lived backend could not offer;
		//  - the minted-order case needs `tier.payments`, which a tier that
		//    composes no payment gateway cannot offer.
		// Neither is a weakened case. Each runs in full on any tier that has the
		// hook — the in-process tier has both.

		// ── identity: the session is the only credential ───────────────────
		//
		// No method on this port takes a customer id, so the isolation below is
		// STRUCTURAL rather than a filter someone could forget to apply. Each
		// case uses its own email: `reset()` is a documented no-op on a tier whose
		// backend is expensive to rebuild, so a shared address would let one
		// case's claimed order show up in another's list.

// ── Slice 2: admin orders + products (INC-B10b) ───────────────────────────

/**
 * NO CASE HERE WAS LIFTED, and that is the finding rather than an oversight: no
 * test file in `packages/plugin/test/` ever exercised the old HTTP admin orders
 * or products client. There was nothing to move, so the cases below were written
 * against the tier interface from the start — which is why they cost nothing
 * when the HTTP tier was deleted.
 *
 * PRODUCTS IS COVERED (INC-B10b-i) — all six methods: `listProducts`,
 * `getProduct`, `updateProduct`, `restock`, `removeStock`, `getTaxClasses`.
 *
 * ORDERS IS COVERED TOO (INC-B10b-ii) — all twelve: `listOrders`, `getOrder`,
 * `transitionOrder`, `resolveReconciliation`, `recordFulfillment`,
 * `cancelOrder`, `getCustomerContext`, `getTimeline`, `getRefunds`,
 * `refundOrder`, `listNotes`, `addNote`. The orders surface is read through
 * `requireSurface`, so a tier that binds this slice without one fails by name
 * rather than by running its half of the cases against nothing.
 *
 * WHAT THE ORDERS CASES CANNOT ARRANGE, recorded for the same reason the
 * products gaps are: `arrange.order` seeds a PENDING guest order with one
 * digital line, no shipping-address snapshot and no reconciliation flag — which
 * is the state every order is born in — or, with `captured`, a PAID one carrying
 * a settled payment (which is what gives the refund ceiling a non-zero value, so
 * the gateway refund cases can reach the provider). A flagged reconciliation and
 * a `processing` order that can legally be fulfilled are still out of reach from
 * here, so each is asserted in the direction this surface CAN reach — the
 * refusal — and the refusals are the load-bearing half anyway: `NOT_FULFILLABLE`
 * and `NOT_IN_RECONCILIATION`.
 *
 * SEARCH IS ASSERTED AT ITS FLOOR, NEVER AT A TIER'S CEILING (ADR-0019 §6). The
 * shared case pins the three matches every dialect owes — an order-id PREFIX, a
 * folded buyer-ref PREFIX, an EXACT folded line sku — and asserts NO negative on
 * a wider one. A SQL adapter's unanchored buyer-ref SUBSTRING is a sanctioned
 * superset, not a divergence to fix and not a behaviour the document store owes;
 * each tier pins its own side of it in its own file, where the difference is
 * visible as a difference.
 *
 * THE ONE REFUSAL WHOSE REASON DEPENDS ON THE COMPOSITION is a refund against an
 * order that captured nothing. Every tier refuses it with a 409 and leaves the
 * ledger empty — that much is shared — but the REASON differs: a tier with a
 * gateway composed for the order's method is refused because there is no
 * captured payment to refund against (`NO_CAPTURED_PAYMENT`, checked before the
 * ceiling is ever arbitrated), and a tier with none is refused for want of a
 * gateway (`REFUND_GATEWAY_UNAVAILABLE`). Rather than soften the shared case
 * into accepting either, the shared case asserts what both owe and a GATED PAIR
 * — keyed off the `payments` hook, each naming its gate in its own name — pins
 * the reason on each side.
 *
 * WHAT THE SHARED ARRANGE SURFACE CANNOT REACH, recorded so it is not mistaken
 * for a decision: `arrange.product` goes through `upsertProductCommerce`, which
 * holds the invariant "a product with a sku has an inventory row" by seeding one
 * at `0`. So a product with NO sku, a sku with NO inventory row, and therefore
 * the `onHand: null` ("unknown") reading, the `no_sku` refusal and the
 * `no_inventory_row` refusal are all unreachable from here. The `null`/`0`
 * distinction is still asserted in the direction this surface can reach — a
 * seeded zero stays `0` and never becomes `null` — and the unreachable half is
 * held by the in-process client's own unit coverage.
 *
 * TWO STATES THE ADMIN SURFACE READS AND CANNOT WRITE are arranged through the
 * tier's STOREFRONT client instead, because they have exactly one writer each: a
 * soft-deleted row (`softDeleteProductCommerce`) and a sku under a live cart hold
 * (`addCartLine`). Both are load-bearing — `deletedAt` is what the console draws
 * the archived badge from and what the stock-movement tombstone guard turns on,
 * and `sku_held_stock` is a rename refusal with its own copy and its own
 * `liveHolds` operand — so neither may be left to a hand-written stub on one
 * tier.
 *
 * THE ONE `getTaxClasses` READING NOT ASSERTED HERE is the empty registry, and
 * deliberately: the registry is STORE-WIDE and one tier's `reset()` is a
 * documented no-op, so "no classes exist" is a claim no case in a shared file can
 * make without depending on every other case's ordering — the exact coupling this
 * contract's disjoint-ids rule exists to forbid. The branch that reads an empty
 * registry is the console's `readTaxClasses` backstop, and it is pinned where it
 * lives, in `products-console-route.sandbox.test.ts`.
