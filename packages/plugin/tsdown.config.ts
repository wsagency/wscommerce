	 * WHY IT IS REQUIRED NOW. `src/` imports `@otta-sh/store-emdash` and
	 * `@otta-sh/domain` for their VALUES (the in-process commerce client
	 * constructs adapters and use-cases), and both are workspace packages whose
	 * `exports` point at TypeScript SOURCE. A per-file declaration compile tries
	 * to load those sources as if they belonged to this package and fails, because
	 * they belong to a referenced project and are compiled by it. Project mode
	 * reads the reference and consumes the emitted declarations instead, which is
	 * also what `pnpm typecheck` already does.
	 *
	 * It is the JS bundle's `noExternal` below that keeps the shipped artifact
	 * self-contained; this setting only concerns the `.d.mts` files beside it.

	/**
	 * BUNDLE the three commerce workspace packages into the emitted plugin rather
	 * than leaving them as bare specifiers. The in-process commerce client
	 * (work order 02, Phase B/C) constructs `@otta-sh/domain` use-cases over
	 * `@otta-sh/store-emdash` adapters, and the plugin runs inside workerd —
	 * which has no node resolution, so a surviving bare specifier fails at
	 * module instantiation inside the sandbox rather than anywhere readable.
	 * `test/bundle-imports.test.ts` asserts on the emitted output for exactly
	 * that reason. (`@otta-sh/admin-presentation` is deliberately NOT here: it
	 * is a real `dependencies` entry, IO-free, and shared with
	 * `@otta-sh/admin-react`.) `@otta-sh/payments-stripe` joined them at INC-C1b:
	 * the `webhooks/stripe/settle` route verifies the webhook HMAC INSIDE the
	 * isolate, so the adapter has to be in the bundle for the same reason the
	 * other two are, and `@otta-sh/payments-x402` at INC-C5 for exactly the same
	 * reason: `payments/x402-wiring.ts` imports `createHttpFacilitator` and
	 * `X402PaymentGateway` as VALUES, evaluated inside the isolate, where a
	 * surviving bare specifier has no resolver.
