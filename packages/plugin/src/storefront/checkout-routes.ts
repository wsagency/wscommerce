/**
 * Checkout — PLUGIN-OWNED PUBLIC ROUTES (storefront-checkout plan §1.2, shape
 * per ADR-0003 §5, which pre-authorized exactly this: "checkout/confirmation
 * pages follow the same pattern: public plugin route owns the view model and
 * orchestration; a theme page renders it").
 *
 * The responsibility line, unchanged from ADR-0003/0006: the PLUGIN owns every
 * commerce call and the view model; the SITE owns HTML, cookies, redirects,
 * CSRF and the Stripe.js integration. The plugin never sees a cookie and never
 * emits `Set-Cookie` (it structurally cannot — see cart-routes.ts's
 * platform-verified deviation note); it returns values, the site applies them.
 *
 * `storefront/checkout/summary` is deliberately ONE route rather than a quote
 * route the page composes with a separate cart read: ADR-0003 §3 puts all
 * storefront intelligence in the route handler and keeps the theme shim a pure
 * view-model→markup mapping. It composes three upstream calls — cart read, ONE
 * commerce batch (never one per line), quote — and takes the QUOTE's breakdown
 * as authoritative for every total: the two are computed from the same
 * `product_commerce` rows, and if they ever disagree the quote wins, because it
 * is what `createOrderFromCart` will actually charge.
 *
 * ADR-0012: none of this changes `allowedHosts`. The browser→Stripe hops
 * (Stripe.js and `confirmPayment`) belong to the theme page, not to `ctx.http`
 * — which is why Stripe's script host appears NOWHERE in this package, a
 * property `sandbox-clean-guard.test.ts` asserts by scanning `src/`.
