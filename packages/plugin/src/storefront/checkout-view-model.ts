/**
 * The checkout view model — pure (no `ctx`, no IO), so the theme shim stays a
 * view-model→markup mapping (ADR-0003 §3) and every rule below is unit-testable
 * without a sandbox.
 *
 * ── Honest zeros, the rule this module exists to enforce ──────────────────
 * `computeQuote` substitutes a synthetic ZERO-shipping method when no
 * `methodId` is passed, and skips the tax lookup entirely when no `zoneId` is
 * passed (`@otta-sh/domain`'s pricing/quote.ts). So a store with nothing
 * configured — which is every store today — gets `shippingCents: 0` and
 * `taxCents: 0` on the wire, indistinguishable at the number from a genuine
 * free-shipping, zero-tax order.
 *
 * Rendering that as "Free shipping" or "Tax: $0.00" would be a promise the
 * store never made, and an unexplained "—" is indistinguishable from an outage.
 * So a component that was NOT computed carries `money: null` and an honest
 * LABEL; a component that genuinely WAS computed carries its money even at
 * zero. The caller — which knows whether it passed a zone/method — says which.
 *
 * Money crosses this boundary through `formatMoney` (the plugin's one
 * sanctioned money→string boundary) with branded `cents()`/`currency()` inputs,
 * so a float or a bad currency code throws at the parse rather than rendering.
