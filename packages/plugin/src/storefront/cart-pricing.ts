/**
 * Cart informational pricing (Phase 3 group E follow-up — the deferred join
 * `cart-routes.ts`'s read-handler doc names: "a price-annotated cart read is
 * now REACHABLE … deferred as a separate [Service]/[Plugin] follow-up (join
 * in `GET /carts/:cartId`, or a plugin-side batch join)"). This is that
 * plugin-side batch join: `createCartReadRouteHandler` loads the cart's
 * distinct `productId`s through the SAME request-scoped `CommerceBatchLoader`
 * PDP/PLP use (one batch HTTP call per render, never N), then hands the
 * resolved map here.
 *
 * Pure — no `ctx`, no IO — so it is trivially unit-testable and keeps the
 * cart-line wire's own invariant untouched: `CartWire`/`CartLineWire` are
 * NOT modified (a cart line snapshots no price, `commerce-client.ts`'s
 * documented domain invariant); this is an ADDITIVE sibling view built
 * alongside the cart, never a field grafted onto it.
 *
 * A line is priced only when: it carries a non-null `productId`, a commerce
 * row was found for it, that row is `active`, AND its currency matches the
 * cart's own currency (defensive — single-currency site assumed; a
 * mismatched-currency line degrades to unpriced rather than fabricating a
 * converted number — out of scope, see the plan). The cart `total` sums only
 * the priced lines' totals (partial total, never all-or-nothing) and
 * `allLinesPriced` tells the theme whether to caveat the total.
