	 * THE FILTER TRAVELS BESIDE THE CURSOR, and it did not used to.
	 *
	 * The old rule was "send ONLY the cursor when paging, so the two never
	 * disagree", and it was the wrong half of a true observation. The cursor does
	 * embed the filter it was minted under — but the reader, given both, took the
	 * predicate SOLELY from the token and never looked at the filter passed
	 * alongside it. So a page-two request that meant "paid orders" while carrying
	 * an unfiltered token got the unfiltered set, successfully, with nothing in
	 * the result admitting the substitution; upstream, a console deriving its
	 * filters from the address captions those rows "Paid". Passing only the cursor
	 * did not prevent the disagreement — it hid it.
	 *
	 * The implementation now compares the two as PREDICATES and REFUSES the cursor
	 * when they differ, so stating the filter on every call is what turns an
	 * invisible divergence into an answerable one. Agreeing filters are redundant,
	 * not a second opinion.
	 *
	 * NO CASE FOLDING, HERE OR ANYWHERE BEFORE THE STORE. The comparison is
	 * deliberately case-SENSITIVE — the store's case-insensitivity is the store's
	 * business, and a token round-trips whatever it was minted with — so a caller
	 * that helpfully lowercased a search term on one call and not on the other
	 * would manufacture mismatches out of nothing.
	 *
	 * WHAT THE CALLER OWES: for a filter derived from a RELATIVE period, the
	 * instants passed here must be the ones the cursor was minted under, not a
	 * fresh resolution of the same words. `orders-read.ts`'s `periodWindow`
	 * resolves presets to WHOLE-DAY bounds precisely so that holds — two calls on
	 * the same UTC day resolve identically, which is every call in a paging
	 * session bar one that crosses UTC midnight. That crossing describes a
	 * genuinely different window, so the refusal and the page-one recovery are the
	 * correct answer to it rather than a defect to design around.
	 *
	 * A REFUSED CURSOR IS RECOVERED HERE, not reported: the implementation drops
	 * the token, re-issues page one with the same filter, and flags the result
	 * `cursorRejected` so a consumer can say out loud that it did not get the page
	 * it asked for — or discard the rows, which a console refused mid-scan does.
	 * An unreachable store still fails loudly; those two want opposite treatments
	 * of the address bar, and collapsing them into one "list failed" is what made
	 * the console guess.
