/**
 * The admin Tax console page (admin-UX density overhaul, §12.3 of
 * `docs/admin/ADMIN-CONSOLE.md`) — a 3-level scaffold screen: tax classes
 * (registry create/list) drilling into a class's tax rates (list/create/
 * edit-with-CAS/delete), which — ONLY past L-9's 25-row bound — drills once
 * more into a single rate's own detail (the L-7 fallback's "drill-in", so a
 * rate past row 25 stays reachable without reviving the per-row inline forms
 * this overhaul removes).
 *
 * THE DENSITY FIX THIS SCREEN EXISTS FOR. The previous layout rendered an edit
 * form plus a delete button INLINE, for every row, SIMULTANEOUSLY — N rows
 * cost N × (48px divider + ~5 field rows). Per-row content now lives inside a
 * collapsed `accordion` (default_open false), one per class / one per rate,
 * and every `divider` is gone (R-4).
 *
 * L-9 IS A RUNTIME BRANCH, NOT A DESIGN-TIME ASSUMPTION. A level renders as
 * the per-row accordion list ONLY when the fetched page is complete
 * (`nextCursor === null`, i.e. `nextToken === undefined`) AND `items.length
 * <= 25`; otherwise it renders a `table` + an L-7 `combobox` drill-in, because
 * `table.next_cursor` + "Load more" is the only paging affordance in the
 * whole vocabulary — deleting the table would make row 26 unreachable. Both
 * branches ship on both list levels; the sandbox suite asserts the branch at
 * 25 rows and at 26.
 *
 * TAX OWNS THE `toggle` ELEMENT. "Applies to shipping" is the one boolean on
 * this screen, and this is the first (only) screen to use `toggle` — see
 * `scaffold/list-detail.ts`'s `readBoolean`, added in this same change because
 * `readString` returns `undefined` for a real boolean and every prior parser
 * read `"true"`/`"false"` STRINGS that a toggle never sends.
