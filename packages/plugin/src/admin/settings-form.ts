/**
 * The admin Settings screen (§4.1 report/settings skeleton;
 * `docs/admin/ADMIN-CONSOLE.md` §12.6) — ONE page, THREE named groups, THREE
 * save paths made visible, not hidden:
 *  - `storeDisplayName` (kv tier, "Store" group) saves via `ctx.kv.set`.
 *  - `holdTtlMinutes` / `lowStockThreshold` (operational tier, "Checkout &
 *    holds" group) save through the reporting/settings client `makeAdminClients`
 *    hands back. Since INC-D3a that is ALWAYS the in-process client writing this
 *    plugin's own store — no HTTP hop, no token — and its validation rejection
 *    is surfaced INLINE (never swallowed), read from the structural `reason`
 *    rather than from an HTTP status the in-process tier does not have.
 *  - the write-only payment/email credentials ("Payments & email" group) save
 *    into write-only plugin kv, one key per secret ({@link PAYMENT_SECRET_FIELDS}).
 *
 * RETIRED (work order 02, INC-D3a): this screen used to carry a FOURTH
 * "Service connection" group with two more write-only secret forms —
 * `internalToken` (`X-Internal-Token`, the token the guarded `/reports/*`
 * reads and the privileged `PUT /settings` needed) and `serviceToken`
 * (`X-Service-Token`, ADR-0007's machine write-gate the service enforced on
 * every non-GET). Both existed to authenticate THIS plugin to the standalone
 * `@otta-sh/service` package (now deleted) as a separate deployable. Now that
 * the commerce service is folded into the plugin (ADR-0014/0015) there is
 * nothing left on the other side of that call to authenticate to, so both
 * tokens, their kv keys,
 * their save-generation counters, and the group that held their forms are
 * gone outright rather than kept as dead provisioning UI. The INC-09
 * write-only, never-masked discipline they pioneered survives below in
 * {@link paymentsGroup} — the credentials that still need it.
 *
 * S-5 / S-4: every save re-renders the FULL screen (all three accordions) plus
 * a notice banner — never a fragment. Two live bugs this fixes (§12.6):
 * `save-display`'s success path used to return `[header, section]` (every other
 * form vanished, and since the host's `page_load` effect never re-fires
 * on its own, the operator had to navigate away to recover — the receipt was
 * terminal), and the invalid-name branch used to return `[header, banner]`
 * with no field to correct. Both branches now go through {@link renderPage}.

 *
 * INC-15 amends S-3 for THIS screen: all three groups now render
 * `default_open: false`, and each group's LABEL carries its own current values
 * ("Checkout & holds — 15 min hold · low stock at 5"), so a closed group still
 * answers the question the operator opened the screen to ask. The screen used
 * to open "Store" — the ONE cosmetic field on it — pushing the two groups that
 * hold operational and payment state below an expanded form. With the values
 * on the labels there is nothing to rank: S-3's "exactly one" was a way to pick
 * a default, not a requirement that something be expanded, and the mechanical
 * rule (X-18) is "AT MOST one `default_open: true` per response". Zero is legal
 * and is what this screen now emits.
 *
 * This is the RENDER-TIME kind of closing, which §1.2 explicitly permits — no
 * `block_id` is changed to force a group shut, so no operator input is ever
 * discarded (that is the forbidden "programmatic accordion close").

 * value redisplays correctly (the forms are mount-only `text_input` — INC-09
 * dropped the one `secret_input` this screen used to render — and once inside
