/**
 * `InProcessReportingSettingsClient` — the admin REPORTING + SETTINGS surface
 * (revenue, orders-by-status, top products, low stock, and the operational
 * settings tier) with commerce truth held on the plugin's own document store
 * (work order 02, INC-B10c-ii).
 *
 * WHAT THIS CLASS IS. The sole implementation of `ReportingSettingsSurface`: the
 * same six methods, the same argument shapes, the same RETURN VALUES — every field
 * the `*Wire` types carry — with the `@otta-sh/domain` reporting/settings use-cases
 * composed over the `@otta-sh/store-emdash` adapters bound to `ctx.storage`
 * instead of a commerce service. Nothing here reaches for egress; `ctx.http` is
 * never touched.
 *
 * `refundedCents` IS ALWAYS EMITTED, zero included. The wire type marks it
 * optional for exactly one reason — a service older than the field omits it — and
 * this tier is not that service. `0` is the FACT "nothing came back in this
 * bucket"; the KEY's absence would be the different fact "this transport cannot
 * report refunds at all". Dropping a zero here would collapse the two and stop a
 * renderer from ever being able to tell them apart.
 *
 * A LOW-STOCK ROW IS NEVER TITLED WITH ITS SKU. `title` is the live product's
 * title or `null`, and null is the only fallback — the port's rule, passed
 * through unchanged. Four distinct causes produce null (no sku claim, a released
 * claim, a claim held by a VARIANT rather than the product row, or a live product
 * whose own title is genuinely null), and all four mean "we do not know its
 * name", which is not the same statement as "it is called SKU-42".
 *
 * TOP PRODUCTS GROUPS BY `(productId, title)`, not by the product. A product sold
 * under two titles is legitimately two rows, because the line snapshot froze the
 * title at purchase time and the title is a fact about the SALE. Merging them
 * would rewrite history to whatever the product is called today.
 *
 * AN EMPTY PERIOD IS OMITTED, never zero-filled. Zero-filling is a renderer's job
 * and it needs the report's own silence to know which days it is filling; a
 * report that invented the zeros would leave nothing to distinguish "no orders"
 * from "no data".
 *
 * HOW A REFUSED INPUT SURFACES. The request schemas that stood in front of the
 * `/reports/*` and `/settings` routes are mirrored below through
 * `commerce-input.ts`, and a refused input SHAPE — a malformed instant, an
 * interval or metric that is not one, a limit or threshold out of bounds, an
 * empty idempotency key — REJECTS with a structural `INVALID_INPUT` naming the
 * field, exactly as the rules and products clients do. It never resolves to a
 * synthesized status, because there is no wire here to have one.
 *
 * `updateSettings` IS THE ONE METHOD THAT DOES NOT THROW for a refused VALUE, and
 * the distinction is deliberate: the wire type's whole purpose is that a bad
 * `holdTtlMinutes` comes back as `{ ok: false }` for the form to render inline
 * rather than as an exception the page has to catch. So input SHAPE rejects and a
 * refused VALUE resolves — the same split the HTTP tier has, where the 400 body
 * is a result and a transport failure is a throw.
 *
 * AND THE FAILURE ARM CARRIES `reason`, NOT A FABRICATED `status`. A
 * compare-and-set loss comes back `reason: "superseded"` with no status at all.
 * Inventing a `409` would be indistinguishable from a real one and would teach
 * the console to read a transport artefact this transport does not have — the
 * ratified INC-B10a rule: a typed failure is represented structurally in-process,
 * never mapped onto an invented HTTP status.
 *
 * NO ADMIN AUTH HERE, deliberately (ADR-0014 D3). `X-Internal-Token` /
 * `X-Service-Token` authenticate a caller TO THE SERVICE, and there is no service
 * here; EmDash's own admin auth and CSRF gate the console routes that construct
 * this. So the constructor takes no token of any kind, and there is nothing for
 * one to be forgotten in.
 *
 * SANDBOX-CLEAN. No `fetch`, no `node:` builtin, no host import.
