/**
 * `InProcessAdminOrdersClient` — the admin Orders console surface with commerce
 * truth held on the plugin's own document store (work order 02, INC-B10b-ii).
 *
 * WHAT THIS CLASS IS. The sole implementation of `AdminOrdersSurface`: the same
 * twelve methods, the same argument shapes, the same RETURN VALUES — including
 * every field the `*Wire` types carry — with the `@otta-sh/domain` use-cases
 * composed over the `@otta-sh/store-emdash` adapters bound to `ctx.storage`
 * instead of a commerce service. Nothing here reaches for egress itself; the one
 * outbound call a refund can make belongs to the injected payment gateway.
 *
 * NO FIELD IS NARROWED, and that is a rule rather than a preference. The React
 * admin screens consume these results through `console-api.ts` STRUCTURAL
 * mirrors — they import no wire type — so a field quietly dropped here is
 * invisible to the compiler and breaks at runtime. In particular:
 *  - `OrdersListResult.total` is always present on a page this tier served, and
 *    an ABSENT total is never spelled `0` (that would caption a page of rows
 *    with a count of none);
 *  - `cursorRejected` is only ever `true`, never `false` and never "present but
 *    unset" — it means "you asked for a page you did not get";
 *  - `allowedTransitions` is DERIVED from the domain state machine
 *    (`legalNextStates`), never re-listed here;
 *  - `deletedAt`-style tombstone semantics carry over from products: a non-null
 *    stamp means tombstoned, and nothing collapses it into absence;
 *  - `shippingAddress` is the order's immutable checkout SNAPSHOT (ADR-0009) and
 *    is read off the order row — never re-read from the mutable profile address
 *    book, which appears (separately) on the customer-context panel;
 *  - `RefundsSummaryWire.finalizedTotalCents` is the watermark the refund action
 *    reads (`refundedTotalCents` is the ACTIVE sum the remainder comes from), and `refundable` is the gateway's HONEST capability — neither is
 *    softened;
 *  - `updatedAt` doubles as the optimistic-concurrency token elsewhere in the
 *    admin surface, so an order's stamps pass through as the store spells them.
 *
 * NO ADMIN AUTH HERE, deliberately (ADR-0014 D3). EmDash's own admin auth and
 * CSRF gate the console route that constructs this; there is no service to
 * authenticate to, so there is nothing to authenticate WITH. The HTTP tier's
 * `X-Internal-Token` / `X-Service-Token` are transport concerns and stay on the
 * transport. What DOES carry over is the route's status mapping: the HTTP
 * client's failure results are `{ ok: false, status }`, so this tier synthesizes
 * the very status the route would have answered with (404 for an unknown order,
 * 409 for a state-machine/ceiling conflict, 400 for a refused input) rather than
 * inventing a code of its own.
 *
 * WHAT WAS PORTED, AND FROM WHERE. Four pieces of the standalone
 * `@otta-sh/service` package's admin route layer (now deleted) are behaviour
 * rather than framing, so they are mirrored here and named so the two could be
 * compared by eye:
 *  - the orders list's opaque cursor (position + filter + limit, base64url JSON),
 *    its RE-VALIDATION on decode, and the fail-closed disagreement check between
 *    a token's filter/limit and the caller's — plus the client-side recovery that
 *    re-issues page one and flags `cursorRejected`;
 *  - the order serializers (`serializeOrder`, `serializeOrderSummary` from
 *    `routes/orders.ts`, plus the customer-context / timeline / refund / note
 *    serializers in `admin.ts`), field for field;
 *  - the per-command idempotency FALLBACK keys the route mints when a caller
 *    sends no header (`admin:transition:…`, `admin:cancel:…`, and the rest), so a
 *    header-less double-submit dedupes identically on both tiers;
 *  - the REFUND CEILING, which is arithmetic the route composes rather than a
 *    use-case it calls: `Σ captured` (succeeded payments only) and the frozen
 *    order total give `computeRefundCeiling`, `Σ active refunds` (status ≠
 *    `voided`) is subtracted, and the remainder floors at zero. The three summands
 *    are real `@otta-sh/domain` exports; the COMPOSITION lived in the route, and
 *    now lives here too.
 *
 * THE GATEWAYS ARE INJECTED, never resolved here. The composition root
 * (`makeAdminClients`) resolves them from kv exactly as `makeCommerceClient` does
 * and passes them in through `options.gateways`; a method with no gateway in that
 * map is the honest "no gateway wired for this order's method", and the refund
 * POST answers it with `409 REFUND_GATEWAY_UNAVAILABLE` (fail-closed). The only
 * egress a refund makes is the gateway's own, over the `ctx.http` the root bound
 * it to — this class never touches `ctx.http` itself.
 *
 * A REFUND ROW CARRIES ITS `status`, as the service's `serializeRefund` did: a
 * `voided` or in-flight attempt is on the ledger for audit, and a console that
 * could not tell it from a finalized refund would list money that never moved.
 *
 * SEARCH IS PREFIX-ONLY ON THIS TIER, and that is the ADR-0019 §6 floor rather
 * than a gap: id PREFIX or folded buyerRef PREFIX or EXACT folded line sku. A SQL
 * adapter may serve an unanchored buyer-ref substring as a sanctioned SUPERSET;
 * a document store has no substring operator and serves the floor. Each tier pins
 * its own side in its own tests.
 *
 * INPUT IS REFUSED AT THE BOUNDARY, as in `InProcessCommerceClient` — the request
 * schemas that used to stand in front of every call are mirrored through
 * `commerce-input.ts`. Where the HTTP tier turns a refused input into a TYPED
 * RESULT (every command's `{ ok: false, status: 400 }`), this returns that value
 * too; where it throws (the reads), this rejects.
 *
 * SANDBOX-CLEAN. No `fetch`, no `node:` builtin, no host import.
