/**
 * The admin Coupons console — built against `docs/admin/ADMIN-CONSOLE.md`
 * §12.2, pattern-matched on the reference screen (`orders-page.ts`, §11).
 * A 2-level scaffold screen (list → leaf detail/edit) over `AdminRulesSurface`.
 *
 * THE SHAPE, in one paragraph. The list is `header` + one `context` + an
 * optional notice `banner` + an INLINE one-field search (L-2: 1 field renders
 * directly, no accordion) + the table — nothing else above the data (P-1).
 * The detail is `header` + back + notice + a lifecycle `banner` on the
 * exceptions only + the 6-entry identity strip (D-1a's cap; `Status` leads it
 * and the redundant `Code` row is gone — the header already carries the code),
 * then TWO task-named panels — `Coupon` · `Redemptions` (D-2, D-2a: a would-be
 * `History` panel would hold only Created, which lives in the identity strip
 * instead) — whose one named group (`Edit`) is a CLOSED `accordion`.
 *
 * WHY THIS SCREEN HAS NO RENDER-STATE CHANNEL FOR DA-3. Every destructive/
 * risky write here is DA-2 (delete: no input, forbid-if-redeemed) or DA-4
 * (create/save: plain forms, no confirm) — there is no free-text-or-typed-
 * amount flow that would need DA-3's stage/confirm shape, so this screen
 * carries none of Orders' refusal machinery. It DOES use the render-state
 * channel, for a NON-DA-3 purpose the spec also assigns it (E-2): saying that
 * THIS render is the create screen rather than the list, and — on a refusal —
 * carrying back what the operator typed into it. See {@link CouponsRenderState}.
 *
 * CREATING IS A DRILL-IN, NOT A GROUP AT THE BOTTOM (INC-14). "New coupon" is
 * a `primary` BUTTON emitted directly under the intro line, above the data;
 * clicking it renders the create screen in place of the list (header · back ·
 * notice · context · form), the same button-drill-in idiom Tax and Shipping
 * already use for "View rates" (§12.7). L-8's create `accordion` at the very
 * bottom is GONE from this screen: it put the one action an empty console
 * needs last, below the picker, rendered as a link the eye reads as another
 * row affordance. Nothing about what a create SUBMITS changed.
 *
 * THE F-5a TRAP THIS SCREEN IS BUILT TO AVOID. `updateCoupon` is a FULL
 * REPLACE: every omitted key is coerced to `null` unconditionally, so there is
 * no partial update. So the edit form is NEVER split into sibling forms
 * (F-5a forbids it here: splitting would let an operator saving a "Discount"
 * form silently wipe `startsAt`/`expiresAt`/`maxUses`/`maxUsesPerCustomer`).
 * It stays ONE form, kept inside budget by `condition`-gating the type-
 * specific economics fields (F-5b) and by F-5c's full-replace exemption
 * (cap 8; this form is F-5c's one named instance — 6 fields for a
 * `fixed_amount` coupon, 7 for `percentage`).
 *
 * B-3's CHANGE TOKEN, WITHOUT A SECOND HASH. `CouponSummaryWire` has no
 * `updatedAt`, so the edit form's `block_id` needs SOME value that changes
 * when the coupon's mutable fields do. Rather than hand-rolling a second
 * digest, this screen relies on {@link carriedForm}'s OWN prefill digest
 * (`__v`, B-3a) — it is already a hash of every field's `initial_value` in
 * order, which for this form IS exactly the coupon's mutable economics/window/
 * use-bound fields. B-3a's own text says this is not belt-and-braces; adding a
 * second hand-rolled hash alongside it would be exactly that.
 *
 * L-7's PICKER IS A `combobox`, NEVER A `select`. The option value is an
 * encoded drill path (opaque, not a human word) — a `select` would render
 * that raw value in its trigger (R-17a, X-22); `combobox` renders the label
 * (R-17b).
 *
 * `type`, `code` and `couponId` are IMMUTABLE identity/kind (F-2): none is a
 * form field anywhere on this screen. They ride invisibly in a form's
 * `block_id` carrier (edit) or a button's `value` (delete).

 * hard maximum of 6. A director-ratified exemption, not a reading of the rule:
 * INC-07 mandates both `Status` and `Min spend` while `Code` / `Discount` /
 * `Valid` keep their semantics, which is six. T-1's rule text is reconciled in
 * a docs follow-up.
 *
 * `Status` ANSWERS THE QUESTION THE SCREEN EXISTS FOR. Without it the only
 * signal that `EXPIRED20` ended a month ago and `LAUNCH2026` has not started
 * is the raw date text in `Valid`, which makes an operator do date arithmetic
 * across every row of a screen whose whole purpose is "which discounts are
 * live right now". It is computed here, per render, from the coupon's own
 * fields — see {@link couponStatus}.
 *
 * `Status` IS PLAIN TEXT, NOT A BADGE, and that is a decision rather than an
 * omission. The right rendering is "badge the exceptions, leave the happy path
 * quiet" — an `expired` mark that pulls the eye, and nothing at all on the
 * live rows. Block Kit cannot express it: `format` is a property of the
 * COLUMN, not of a cell (the renderer's `formatCell` reads `col.format`), so a
 * table badges every row of a column or none of them. Blanking the happy-path
 * cell to fake the split is worse than either end — the renderer's `Badge`
 * draws its pill from padding and a radius alone, so an empty cell in a badge
 * column is a solid mark with no word in it, i.e. the loudest possible
 * rendering of "nothing to report". So the choice is all rows badged or none,
 * and none wins: a pill on every live coupon spends the screen's heaviest ink
 * on its least informative value (exactly T-5's "never badge a property that
 * is near-constant across rows"), while the WORD `expired` already retires the
 * arithmetic this column was added to kill.
 *
 * THIS SCREEN WAS THE ODD ONE OUT WHEN IT SHIPPED; IT IS THE RULE NOW. INC-10
 * took the reasoning above console-wide — Orders, Products and Reports all
 * demoted their status badges to plain text — so the last remaining badge
 * column in the console is Shipping's `Type`, a two-value closed set with no
 * happy path to be near-constant about. What was left open here ("badging only
 * the exceptions belongs to the console-wide policy") is settled: the exception
 * is marked in the CELL'S OWN WORDS. This column needs no extra word for it,
 * because every value it renders except `active` already IS the exception
 * spelled out — `expired`, `scheduled`, `used up` — and the leaf's own
 * `statusBanner` states the consequence in full.

 * The full-replace edit form. Three properties carry this screen's safety.

 * (1) EVERY SET VALUE RIDES AS `initial_value`, NEVER AS A `placeholder`. A

 * partial update, a set value rendered as one is a silent unset of something
 * the operator could SEE on screen when they pressed Save (`PM §E3` — the
 * P0-class check this increment is gated on). A `placeholder` here may only be
 * a FORMAT EXAMPLE on a field that is genuinely empty, and the window fields no
 * longer need even that: a `date_input` IS its own format.
 *
 * (2) THE FOUR BOUNDS ARE COLLAPSED, AND THE FORM IS STILL ONE FORM. Seven
 * full-bleed inputs stacked — five of them empty on a typical coupon — is the
 * worst proportion offender in the console (`DESIGNER §3`), and the fix is to
 * put the rarely-touched bounds behind a closed disclosure. It CANNOT be a
 * second `accordion`, because an accordion holds blocks and a form's fields are
 * not blocks: a second group would mean a second FORM, which F-5a forbids here
 * for the same reason this whole increment exists (saving the "Discount" half
 * would null the window and the use bounds). A `toggle` + `condition` gets the
 * same collapsed shape inside ONE submit. Nothing is hidden by it that the leaf
 * does not already show as read-only text: the cap rides in `Discount`, the
 * floor in `Minimum spend`, and both use bounds in the Redemptions panel.
 *
 * (3) A FIELD THAT NEVER REACHED THE SUBMIT KEEPS ITS CURRENT VALUE. Today a
 * `condition`-hidden field's value DOES arrive — `blocks/form.tsx` seeds its
 * state from every field's `initial_value` and posts that state whole, while
 * its render pass returns `null` for the hidden ones. But that is an
 * interaction between two upstream implementation details, and `carrier.ts`
 * REJECTS relying on it as a hidden-context channel precisely because a future
 * release could legitimately change it. Depending on it for data PRESERVATION
 * would leave every collapsed bound one upstream refactor away from the exact
 * loss this increment retires. So the form ALSO carries each current value in
 * its `block_id`, and the parsers treat an ABSENT key as "unchanged" while a
 * PRESENT BLANK one stays the explicit unset the group's banner promises. The
 * two answers differ only under a renderer that drops hidden fields — and there
 * the carrier is the safe one.
 *
 * `couponId`/`code`/`type` ride invisibly in the same carrier (F-2); B-3's
 * change token is `carriedForm`'s own prefill digest (`__v`, B-3a) — a second,
 * hand-rolled hash would be belt-and-braces B-3a already says not to add.

 * A window bound, from whatever the form submitted plus the instant it carried.

 *    but is not a string is a different thing entirely and is REFUSED: the
 *    operator gets a banner naming the field, never a save that silently
 *    reports success while quietly meaning "unchanged".
 *  - BLANK ⇒ `null`, no bound — the explicit unset.
 *  - THE DAY THE CARRIED INSTANT ALREADY FALLS ON ⇒ that instant, BYTE FOR
 *    BYTE. A `date_input` shows days, so re-submitting the day it was already
 *    showing is not an edit, and an untouched save must never move a bound the
 *    screen only ever displayed to day precision.
 *  - ANY OTHER DAY ⇒ that day's own EDGE: a start OPENS at `00:00:00.000Z`, an
 *    expiry CLOSES at `23:59:59.999Z`. Not cosmetic. The domain's window is
 *    `[startsAt, expiresAt)` — the end bound is EXCLUSIVE (`validateCoupon`) —
 *    so an expiry pinned to midnight would retire the code at the START of the
 *    day the operator picked: a full day early, and a day earlier than this
 *    screen's own `Valid` reading claims.
 *
 * PRESERVATION BEATS REPAIR, AND THAT HAS A COST WORTH NAMING. A record
 * written before this change holds a midnight expiry, which under the exclusive
 * end bound still retires the code at the start of its stated day. Re-saving
 * the coupon untouched will NOT quietly repair it — the third case above sees
 * the same day and keeps the same instant — so correcting a legacy bound takes
 * a deliberate two-save dance: move the date off the day, save, move it back,
 * save. That is the right trade: an untouched save silently rewriting a stored
 * instant is exactly the class of surprise this leaf exists to remove, and a
 * repair that only fires when the operator did nothing is indistinguishable
 * from the data loss it would be if the heuristic were ever wrong.
 *
 * A full ISO datetime still parses and is still NORMALIZED to ISO-8601 UTC:
 * the wire is untrusted, older records hold one, and `validateCoupon` compares
 * these strings LEXICOGRAPHICALLY, so a non-ISO shape would mis-order silently.
