/**
 * The Orders WRITE path, as structured actions (ADR-0015 Decision 2).
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES, and why the replacement was a rewrite rather than a
 * deletion. Until this module existed, the React console did not have a write
 * path of its own: it constructed the Block Kit Orders page handler, forwarded
 * every click through it as a synthesized `block_action`, and then SCRAPED the
 * outcome back out of the rendered block tree — the banner off the render, and an
 * empty tree read as "nothing applied". The Block Kit renderer was therefore
 * load-bearing for the screen that replaced it. Each action below is that write,
 * re-expressed as a function returning an {@link OrdersActionResult}: the
 * applied/refused flag and the notice. No page handler, no synthesized
 * interaction, no notice-scraping.
 *
 * THE STALE-WATERMARK REFUSAL IS CARRIED VERBATIM (ADR-0015 Decision 3, as
 * amended). A reworded check is a failed port, not a port. **DA-3a:** the
 * watermark the operator SAW — `refundedSoFarCents` on the money path, the order
 * `state` on every other — is re-read against live truth and the write REFUSES on
 * a mismatch. Every site holding a watermark also refuses an ABSENT one, with no
 * re-read and no exemption: see {@link readWatermark}.
 *
 * MONEY IS INTEGER MINOR UNITS. Nothing here parses money with a float:
 * {@link parseCents} reads an untrusted payload's integer minor-units string, and
 * rejects anything that is not a plain non-negative integer.
 *
 * NO NONCE, ANYWHERE. Every write derives its idempotency key from its own content
 * plus the watermark the operator saw — for a refund,
 * `admin-refund:${orderId}:${amountCents}:${refundedSoFarCents}` (F-2a). That is
 * what lets two deliberate identical refunds both apply while a double-click
 * dedupes, and a render-time nonce cannot do it safely: the domain resolves a
 * refund by key ALONE with no amount comparison, so a reused key with a different
 * amount renders a success-shaped "Already refunded" for money that never moved.
 *
 * EVERY FIELD ARRIVING HERE IS UNTRUSTED operator-round-tripped input, exactly as
 * a Block Kit `button.value` or a decoded carrier was: closed sets are re-checked,
 * watermarks are re-checked for PRESENCE as well as for equality, and nothing is
 * coerced.
 *
 * THE `-review` PAIR IS GONE, DELETED AS UNREACHED SURFACE. `orders:refund-review`
 * and `orders:cancel-review` — with the staged/draft state that existed only for
 * them — were carried across by the extraction and then found to have NO CALLER:
 * the React order detail stages its own confirm client-side and posts
 * `orders:refund` / `orders:cancel` / `orders:cancel-<reason>` directly. Its
 * per-reason controls deliberately omit `other` (the note form's reason picker is
 * the only path that records a detail), so `orders:cancel-other` had no control
 * that could send it either, and it is not derived. See ADR-0015's amendment.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WITH THEM, STATED PLAINLY rather than left for a reader to discover.
 * Two checks lived ONLY on `refund-review`, so neither ever ran for any surface:
 * the **DA-3c live-ceiling bound check**, and the **unparseable-amount refusal**
 * whose draft carried the operator's raw text verbatim. The reachable confirm
 * ({@link refundOrderAction}) is not unguarded: it re-reads the ledger and refuses
 * on a watermark mismatch (DA-3a), and an over-ceiling amount that survives that is
 * refused by the SERVICE as `REFUND_EXCEEDS_TOTAL` / `REFUND_EXCEEDS_CAPTURED`,
 * which {@link refundFailureNotice} renders. Re-introducing a server-side two-step
 * confirm means WRITING these checks against the shape of that new flow — not
 * restoring them, because there is nothing left to restore.
 *
 * KNOWN FOLLOW-UP, ported verbatim and deliberately left alone here:
 * {@link resolveReconciliationAction} derives its idempotency key as
 * `admin-resolve-reconciliation:${orderId}` with no `expectedFlag` component, so two
 * different resolutions of two different anomalies on the SAME order derive the same
 * key; the second is answered from the idempotency store as already-resolved and the
 * new flag is never cleared. Pre-existing behaviour of the deleted handler, carried
 * across unchanged so this module is a port and not a rewrite. Fixing it changes a
 * key and therefore needs its own increment.

/**
 * The money-moving write — DA-2b's full-remaining control and the partial refund
 * the surface confirmed for itself both land here. It is the ONLY refund handler:
 * the `-review` step that used to precede it is deleted, so every guard a refund
 * gets is in this function or in the service behind it.
 *
 * TWO RULES APPLY TOGETHER, and neither is sufficient alone:
 *  - DA-3a: RE-READ the refund ledger and refuse on a watermark mismatch, so a
 *    stale amount is never applied. Operator A opens a confirm for $99.00;
 *    operator B refunds $99.00; A's dialog still says "Refund $99.00" — a false
 *    statement.
 *  - F-2a: derive the key from `${orderId}:${amountCents}:${refundedSoFarCents}`.
 *    The watermark makes two DELIBERATE identical refunds differ (so both apply)
 *    while a double-click of the same control dedupes.
 *
 * THE WATERMARK IS THE FINALIZED TOTAL (issue #303 review), never the active
 * one. A gateway attempt that ended RETRYABLE or UNVERIFIED leaves a
 * `reserved`/`unverified` row that holds ceiling capacity but moved no money
 * yet. Were it counted, the operator's "try again" would be refused as "someone
 * else refunded this order", the same-key RESUME the domain offers would be
 * unreachable, and a re-entered refund under a new key would leave the orphan
 * reservation holding capacity for good. Counting only finalized money keeps the
 * retry on the SAME key: RETRYABLE resumes and issues once, UNVERIFIED answers
 * "status unknown" again without calling the provider.
 *
 * A VOIDED ATTEMPT SPENDS ITS KEY. The domain replays a voided key's rejection,
 * so the key gains `:v<n>` — the count of THIS refund's voided attempts on the
 * LIVE ledger, i.e. voided rows whose key is the base key or `<base>:v<k>` —
 * once one exists. A deliberate retry after a definite provider rejection is
 * then a new intent. Another refund's rejection on the same order never counts:
 * it would move a retryable refund off the key its reservation is held under,
 * orphaning that reservation and risking a second issue.
 *
 * They compose: DA-3a rejects the stale submit before the key is ever derived,
 * which matters because `refundOrder` resolves a duplicate by KEY ALONE with no
 * amount comparison.
 *
 * THERE IS NO CLIENT-SIDE CEILING CHECK HERE, and that is a deliberate, recorded
 * gap rather than an omission: the live-ceiling bound check lived only on the
 * deleted `-review` step. An over-ceiling amount that clears the watermark compare
 * is refused by the SERVICE as `REFUND_EXCEEDS_TOTAL` / `REFUND_EXCEEDS_CAPTURED`
 * and rendered by {@link refundFailureNotice}. See ADR-0015's amendment.
 *
 * NOR IS THERE A `Refunded by` GUARD, for the same reason: the `REFUND_BY_REQUIRED`
 * refusal also lived only on that step. A blank one is recorded as `admin` below.
 * Attribution is therefore enforced by the surface alone — recorded, with its known
 * gap, in the same amendment.
