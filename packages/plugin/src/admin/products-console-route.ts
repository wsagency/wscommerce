/**
 * The React console's read/write surface on the Pricing & inventory screen
 * (INC-21).
 *
 * IT IS `orders-console-route.ts` ONE SCREEN ALONG, and the reasoning there
 * applies here unchanged: ADR-0014 Decision 3 gives `otta-console` exactly one
 * data path — it calls the existing authenticated `otta` admin route from the
 * browser with the operator's own session, holding zero capabilities and zero
 * `allowedHosts` — and a React screen must not consume Block Kit blocks,
 * because a Block Kit row carries `"$15.00"` (money already spent, G1) and
 * `"3 · Low"` (a decision already made) rather than the raw amount and the raw
 * count a React tier needs to render either.
 *
 * WRITES ARE STRUCTURED ACTIONS NOW (INC-R3, ADR-0015). They used to be
 * forwarded through the Block Kit Pricing & inventory page handler: four of the
 * five are FORM-shaped, so this module minted the `block_id` CARRIER those forms
 * rode their context in, synthesized the `form_submit` the handler read, and
 * then SCRAPED the outcome back out of the rendered block tree. That made the
 * renderer of the screen this one replaced load-bearing for this one.
 * `products-actions.ts` is that write path, re-expressed as functions returning
 * an outcome: {@link consoleAct} looks the id up in the same table the gate
 * reads and returns what it produced. The console sends one flat payload and the
 * action takes its fields as arguments — no carrier, because a carrier was a
 * rendering device (it kept `productId` from being drawn as a single-option
 * select) rather than a check. Every watermark, every content-derived
 * idempotency key and every word of refusal copy moved across verbatim.
 *
 * "LOW STOCK ONLY" IS A SERVER-SIDE PREDICATE NOW. The console resolves
 * the store's threshold via the settings read this module already made for the
 * `Low` band, and — only once that resolves to a real number — carries it on
 * the outgoing list request as `ProductsListFilter.lowStockThreshold`, the same
 * axis every other filter travels on. The service applies it to the WHOLE
 * catalogue (not the fetched page) and its exact count is taken under the same
 * predicate, so the count now describes the rows on screen and is forwarded
 * rather than withheld. `resolveStockContext` (in `products-read.ts`) makes
 * that one decision, and the one case it still withholds `total` for is the
 * threshold-unreadable one: the request never carried a predicate, so a `total`
 * there would caption an UNFILTERED page as though "Low stock only" had been
 * honoured — see its doc.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO: decide anything about stock or money. Every
 * idempotency key, every watermark comparison, every guarded decrement and
 * every refusal sentence a write can produce is in `products-actions.ts` and
 * covered by `products-actions.sandbox.test.ts`.
 *
 * G5 APPLIES UNCHANGED: every response here is HTTP 200 with an outcome in the
 * body. A refusal is a value.
