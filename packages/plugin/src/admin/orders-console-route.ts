/**
 * The React console's read/write surface on the Orders screen (INC-20).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, stated first because it is the increment's one
 * genuinely load-bearing design decision.
 *
 * ADR-0014 Decision 3 gives `otta-console` exactly one data path: it calls the
 * **existing authenticated `otta` admin route** from the browser, with the
 * operator's own session, holding zero capabilities and zero `allowedHosts`.
 * That route is `POST /_emdash/api/plugins/otta/admin`, and until now it spoke
 * one language — `page_load` / `block_action` / `form_submit` in, Block Kit
 * blocks out. A React screen could in principle consume those blocks. It must
 * not, for four reasons that are all about correctness rather than taste:
 *
 *  1. **Money.** G1 says a money value reaches a screen as integer minor units
 *     and is rendered by `formatMoney`. Block Kit rows carry `"$15.00"` — money
 *     already spent. A React tier fed those strings would have no money to
 *     format, which is why `console-imports-no-workspace-package`'s own comment
 *     says INC-20 "owes the React tier a formatMoney". It is owed raw amounts.
 *  2. **The full id.** §1.3's React-tier rule is a short prefix WITH a copy
 *     button that copies the FULL id. The Block Kit list has no full id in it
 *     anywhere — that is the accepted degradation it was designed around — so
 *     the affordance is unreachable from its blocks by construction.
 *  3. **Filtering without a round trip.** ADR-0014 lists "client-side filter
 *     measured at zero network calls" as what React buys here. Filtering a
 *     rendered table is filtering strings.
 *  4. **Carrier encoding gone.** Same list. Parsing context back out of
 *     `block_id` carriers in a browser would be the carrier encoding, kept.
 *
 * So the console asks the SAME ROUTE for the SAME DATA in a different shape.
 * No new route, no new capability, no `allowedHosts` change, no service change:
 * the interaction `type` is new, the transport, the authorization, the CSRF
 * header and the egress are identical, and every byte still comes from the ONE
 * admin orders surface `makeAdminClients` hands this route — the `ctx.http`
 * client, or the in-process one over the plugin's own document store.
 *
 * WRITES ARE STRUCTURED ACTIONS NOW (INC-R2, ADR-0015). They used to be
 * forwarded through the Block Kit Orders page handler as a synthesized
 * `block_action`, with the outcome SCRAPED back out of the rendered block tree —
 * which made the renderer of the screen this one replaced load-bearing for this
 * one. `orders-actions.ts` is that write path, re-expressed as functions
 * returning an outcome: {@link consoleAct} looks the id up in the same table the
 * gate reads and returns what it produced. Every watermark, every content-derived
 * idempotency key and every word of refusal copy moved across verbatim; nothing
 * about what a write decides changed with the shape it answers in.
 *
 * G5 APPLIES UNCHANGED: every response here is HTTP 200 with an outcome in the
 * body. A refusal is a value.
