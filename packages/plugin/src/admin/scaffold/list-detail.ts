/**
 * The reusable admin list → detail (→ …) dispatch scaffold.
 *
 * A screen is an ordered array of {@link LevelDef}s indexed by drill depth:
 * `levels[0]` renders at path `[]` (the root list), `levels[1]` at a
 * one-deep path (`["ord-1"]`), and so on. Each level is either a keyset-paged
 * `list` or a `leaf` detail. The scaffold owns the STATELESS control flow —
 * open/back/page/apply-filter, cursor + drill-path (de)serialization, and the
 * dispatch every screen shares — while each level's `render` owns its own Block
 * Kit body. Screen-specific side effects (a status transition, appending a
 * note) are registered as {@link customAction}s.
 *
 * TWO CHANNELS RUN FROM A CUSTOM ACTION BACK INTO A LEVEL'S `render`: a
 * {@link Notice} banner ("what happened"), and this screen's own
 * `RenderState` ("what to render now" — which group to open, which values to
 * prefill). Both are arguments to {@link CustomActionApi.showLeaf} /
 * {@link CustomActionApi.showList}; see the `RenderState` note on
 * {@link CustomActionApi} for why the second one exists and what it is not.
 *
 * IO discipline: the ONLY egress is whatever the screen's `client` performs;
 * this module touches neither `fetch` nor `ctx.http` directly, so it never
 * appears among the sandbox-clean guard's offenders.

/**
 * The engine-facing (type-erased) level shape. Screens never build this

 *
 * `RenderState` is the ONE type parameter that is NOT erased here, and that is
 * the whole of the channel's type safety. Everything else (`Client`, `Filter`,
 * `Summary`, `Detail`) is produced and consumed inside a single level, so the
 * factories below can erase it and cast it back with a local soundness argument.
 * Render state instead crosses from ONE closure (a custom action) to ANOTHER (a
 * level's `render`), which no local argument can cover — so it stays visible in
 * the type, and {@link createListDetailHandler} is where the two ends are checked
 * against each other.
 *
 * TWO DELIBERATE ASYMMETRIES MAKE THAT CHECK REAL. Both were found by probing the
 * first version of this channel, which had neither and did not actually hold:
 *
 *  1. `render` is an arrow-typed PROPERTY on both level interfaces, not a method.
 *     TypeScript checks method parameters BIVARIANTLY, so with method syntax a
 *     level could declare a state WIDER than the screen's — say
 *     `{…, amountCents: number}` where the action only ever sends
 *     `{…, amountInput: string}` — and `LevelDef<Wider>` would still be accepted
 *     into a `LevelDef<Draft>[]`. The level then reads `renderState.amountCents`,
 *     typed `number`, `undefined` at runtime, and `.toFixed()` throws — on the
 *     money path, immediately after the refusal this channel exists to render.
 *     A property is checked contravariantly under `strictFunctionTypes`, which
 *     rejects exactly that and still accepts a level that ignores the channel.
 *  2. A LEVEL's default is `unknown`; the CUSTOM-ACTION side's
 *     ({@link CustomActionApi}, {@link CustomActionFn}, {@link customAction},
 *     {@link ListDetailScreenConfig}) stays `never`. They point in opposite
 *     directions on purpose: `unknown` is the widest thing a level can be handed,
 *     so a level written before the channel existed (or one that simply ignores
 *     it) drops into ANY screen's `levels`; `never` is the narrowest thing an
 *     action can send, so a screen that declared no render state cannot pass one
 *     at all — a stray third argument stays a compile error rather than becoming
 *     `unknown`-shaped garbage arriving at a `render`.

// -- custom (side-effecting) actions ------------------------------------------

/**
 * The re-render surface a custom action calls once its side effect is done.
 *
 * `RenderState` IS THE SCREEN'S OWN TYPE, and the scaffold never looks inside it.
 * It answers the question a `notice` cannot: a banner says WHAT HAPPENED, render
 * state says WHAT TO RENDER NOW — which group to open, which values to put back in
 * a form. The spec's DA-3/DA-3a shape needs both at once: a refusal (the record
 * moved under the operator, or they typed `19,99` in an amount field) must
 * re-render **state 1** with the group open and the operator's input preserved,
 * and a banner alone leaves the re-rendered level guessing at both.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT — three properties it is worth being explicit about, because each
 * is a plausible misreading that would break something the scaffold guarantees:
 *
 *  - **NOT STORAGE, and not a wire format.** The value is passed by reference to
 *    the level's `render` inside the SAME response. Nothing is serialized, stored
 *    or echoed to the client, and the next interaction's `renderState` is
 *    `undefined` again. Every screen stays stateless: whatever must survive the
 *    NEXT click still rides in `button.value` or in a form's `block_id` carrier
 *    (see `./carrier.js`) exactly as before. A stage/confirm flow therefore uses
 *    both — render state to show state 2, and the confirm button's `value` to carry
 *    the staged payload and its watermark into the write.
 *  - **NOT DATA.** Pass what to render, not what was read. The custom action's copy
 *    of a record is pre-mutation or (on a DA-3a refusal) known-stale by
 *    construction, so re-rendering from it would show the operator figures that are
 *    already wrong — which is the failure the re-read exists to catch. The engine
 *    still calls the level's own `load`, and the level still renders from what it
 *    returns. (Nothing prevents a screen stuffing a loaded record in here, since
 *    the value is opaque; it is a mistake, and the paragraph above is why.)
 *  - **NOT TRUSTED, and never inspected.** The engine reads no property of it, so a
 *    value whose own getters throw can only blow up in the screen's `render` —
 *    already inside the leaf/list containment, which fails closed to that level's
 *    `onError`. Do not defeat that by validating it here; there is nothing to
 *    validate, and a check would be a new throw site outside a level's try.
 *
 * Type-safety: `RenderState` is the one parameter {@link LevelDef} does not erase,
 * so a screen's levels and its custom actions are checked against each other at
 * the {@link createListDetailHandler} call site. It defaults to `never`, so a
 * screen that declares none cannot pass one by accident.

// -- how a list states its size and its zero states (INC-12) ------------------

/**
 * THE SHARED ANSWER TO "how many, and what if none" — built once here because a
 * filtered-to-zero list is the most common empty state in a live store and every
 * screen was answering it with a different half-measure: one line of `empty_text`,
 * no count anywhere, and no way to undo the filter except reopening the panel and
 * emptying each field by hand.
 *
 * WHAT THE WIRE SUPPORTS, because the copy below is bounded by it. The three
 * admin list endpoints answer `{items, nextCursor, total}` — a page, a way to
 * ask for the next one, and (since INC-23) the exact size of the filtered set.
 * `total` is what the earlier version of this note called "a queued service
 * increment"; the queue moved. So the count this module renders is:
 *
 *  - the WHOLE (filtered) set — `17 orders` — whenever a `total` is present,
 *    on ANY page. It is a COUNT(*) under the same predicate as the page, so it
 *    is exact on page 3 of 3 as much as on page 1;
 *  - the WHOLE (filtered) set from the PAGE ITSELF — same wording — when there
 *    is no `total` but the render is the first page of its filter AND there is
 *    no next cursor. Both halves are needed for that inference: page 1 of many
 *    counts a page, and page 3 of 3 knows nothing about pages 1 and 2 (keyset
 *    paging carries no running offset, and the scaffold deliberately does not
 *    accumulate one across stateless interactions);
 *  - THIS PAGE otherwise — `25 orders on this page`, which is a smaller claim
 *    and a true one. That is now the fallback for a service older than `total`,
 *    and for a level that deliberately withholds one because it narrowed the
 *    fetched page itself (see `ListLevelDef.fetchPage`'s `total`).
 *
 * NOTHING HERE INVENTS A TOTAL. A count that says the set is bigger than the
 * page must have been told so by the service; a renderer that guessed one would
 * produce exactly the number an operator reconciles against and loses.
 *
 * ZERO RENDERS NO COUNT AT ALL — zero ROWS, whatever the `total` says, and a
 * `total` of zero. `0 orders` is never emitted: at zero the state below already
 * says it in words, and a count line repeating it is the "unknown rendered as 0"
 * failure in a costume. A `total` above an empty page is the same self-
 * contradiction from the other direction, and is suppressed with it.
 */

 * review) into `@otta-sh/admin-presentation`, and this module now ADAPTS the

 *
 * WHY. INC-20 gave the console a React Orders list, and its first cut
 * reimplemented a two-branch version of the five outcomes below — so a page-2
 * miss claimed "No orders yet" (a whole-collection claim that render has not
 * earned) and a zero-row page with a cursor still behind it hid `Load more`
 * behind an empty state. Neither is a React bug; both are what happens when a
 * decision argued this carefully is written twice. The DECISION is now shared
 * and each surface keeps only its own rendering — a `Clear filters` button
 * carrying a nav path here, an `onClick` there.
