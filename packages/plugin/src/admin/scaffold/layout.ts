/**
 * The two layout primitives the six admin screens share (admin-UX density
 * increment 1). Deliberately unopinionated about any particular screen — the
 * console design spec dictates per-screen usage and five page teams consume
 * these — so they stay thin, well-documented wrappers over the authoritative
 * block shapes rather than screen-specific builders.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO "FILTER FIELDS IN COLUMNS" HELPER. A `form`'s fields are
 * ALWAYS a full-width vertical stack: `blocks/form.tsx` wraps them in
 * `flex flex-col gap-4` and the `FormField` union has no layout container (true in
 * 0.29.0 and in the pinned 0.31.1). `ColumnsBlock` takes `Block[][]`, so putting a
 * filter's fields side by side would mean splitting ONE filter across several
 * `form` blocks — i.e. several independent submits, each losing the others'
 * unsubmitted edits. So the density win for filters is VERTICAL: collapse the whole
 * form, keep a count of what is on in its label, and put the active values in the
 * `section` beneath it ({@link filterPanel} + {@link filterSummary}). `columns`
 * remains available for composing WHOLE blocks side by side (see `ColumnsBlock`'s note on the renderer's 2-vs-3 grid), which
 * needs no shared helper.
 *
 * IO-FREE: pure block construction.

/**
 * A filter form that does not cost a screenful of scroll: one `form`, collapsed

 * (`Filters (2 active)` — a count, never the values), or rendered inline when it is
 * small enough to not be worth a click. The values go in the `section` beneath,
 * from {@link filterSummary}.
 *
 * Always renders CLOSED. `accordion.default_open` is read once in a `useState`
 * initialiser, so it can neither reopen a panel the operator closed nor be relied
 * on across re-renders — and a filter that reopens itself on every response is the
 * scroll cost this helper exists to remove. It is therefore not an option here.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THE ENGINE GUARANTEES AROUND THIS, so a screen need not remember
 * them:
 *  - At a drill depth ≥ 1 an `apply-filter` submit must carry the drill path or it
 *    would re-filter the ROOT list. `createListDetailHandler` injects that carrier
 *    into every `applyFilter` form it renders, and it looks INSIDE layout
 *    containers — so collapsing a deep filter form here does not silently break it.
 *    To carry the path INVISIBLY (no visible "Scope" dropdown), build the form with
 *    `carriedForm({namespace, context: {[PATH_FIELD]: encodePath(path)}, form})`;
 *    the injection then stands down, but ONLY for the exact current path.
 *  - Accordion open/close is CLIENT side only and fires no interaction, so the
 *    collapsed body is still rendered on every response: this saves scroll, not
 *    work.
 *
 * THROWS in two cases, both of them screen bugs that must not render as something
 * subtly wrong: above {@link MAX_FILTER_FIELDS} authored fields (a design-spec
 * violation collapsing would hide), and when `form` does not carry a prefill digest
 * matching itself (i.e. it did not come from `carriedForm`, or was edited after).
 * Both are contained by `createListDetailHandler` and surface as that screen's
 * fail-closed banner, with the cause in the worker log.
