/**
 * The sandboxed plugin entry (plan §5/§6). Mirrors the real EmDash
 * sandboxed-plugin shape (`export default { hooks?, routes? } satisfies
 * SandboxedPlugin`, verified against `~/em-dash`'s
 * `packages/plugins/{sandboxed-test,webhook-notifier}/src/plugin.ts`) —
 * this is the module `sandbox-entry.ts` loads inside workerd.
 *
 * Phase 1: the four content-sync hooks (`afterSave`/`afterDelete`/
 * `afterPublish`/`afterUnpublish` — the last two are the publish-gate
 * follow-up, activating on publish and deactivating on unpublish). Since "one
 * home per field" (PR 1b) those hooks are LIFECYCLE + TITLE only: they keep a
 * `product_commerce` row in existence for every CMS product, project the
 * content's `data.title` into it, and drive activate/deactivate/soft-delete.
 * Pricing, stock and every other commercial field are owned by
 * `product_commerce` and edited from the admin's Pricing & inventory page.
 * Phase 2 (ADR-0003): the two PUBLIC storefront routes — PDP and PLP are
 * plugin-owned routes (`page:fragments` is trusted-only and unavailable to
 * this sandboxed plugin); `public: true` is the em-dash route flag that
 * skips auth/CSRF so the theme's public pages can invoke them.
 *
 * This plugin declares NO field widget. It used to export a "Product data"
 * Block Kit widget bound to a `commerce` json field on the products
 * collection; that made the CMS content document a second writer of the
 * commercial columns and every publish reverted the console's edits, so it was
 * deleted in PR 1b along with its seed field and descriptor entry.

		// the input; and it wraps the return at HTTP 200, so the status Stripe must
		// see is returned as a FIELD the calling site replays. The third premise —

		// removes: there is no second deployable left to post to, so the plugin
		// verifies the HMAC itself. `public: true` is REQUIRED, not a relaxation: a
