/**
 * Input bounds for the in-process commerce client — the boundary check the wire
 * used to perform.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. When commerce was reached over HTTP, every call
 * passed through a request-body schema before it reached a use-case, and those
 * schemas were not decoration: they are the only thing standing between a
 * storefront-reachable input and a store that trusts what it is handed. Removing
 * the wire removed the schemas with it. This restores them, in front of the same
 * calls, so the in-process transport refuses exactly what the other one refuses.
 *
 * THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST, stated plainly because it is the difference between
 * a rejected request and a store nobody can sync again: `contentUpdatedAt` and
 * `expectedUpdatedAt` are compared as RAW STRINGS, lexicographically, which is
 * only chronological while every value is fixed-width UTC. One garbage
 * high-sorting value stored once (`"ZZZZ"`) makes every later legitimate sync a
 * stale no-op FOREVER, because the ordinary write path preserves the stored
 * watermark and never heals it. So the format is exact — `Date.toISOString()`
 * output, nothing else — and it is checked before any store call.
 *
 * COPIED, NOT IMPORTED, and deliberately: these bounds are mirrored from the
 * service's request schemas, and that package goes away. An import would be a
 * dependency on something scheduled for deletion, and a second reading of a
 * schema file is not what the bound is — the bound is the number. Each mirrored
 * rule is named below so the two can be compared by eye, once, rather than
 * trusted.
 *
 * WHAT IS MIRRORED, per method of the storefront surface:
 *
 *  - every opaque id that travelled as a PATH parameter — cart id, line id,
 *    order id, challenge id, zone and method id — non-empty, at most 200
 *    characters, printable ASCII with no whitespace or control characters;
 *  - `productId` — non-empty only, which is all the product routes ever checked
 *    (their 400 is `MISSING_PRODUCT_ID`); the batch read bounds its ids further
 *    because its schema did;
 *  - `getCommerceBatch` — at most 100 ids, each one bounded as above;
 *  - `variantKey` — non-empty after trimming, which is the whole of what the
 *    variant routes checked (`MISSING_VARIANT_KEY`);
 *  - `title` — 1 to 500 characters, or an explicit null to clear it;
 *  - `price.amount` — a non-negative integer on the product upsert, and a
 *    STRICTLY POSITIVE one on the variant edit, matching the two schemas and the
 *    domain's own rule: an absent price is expressed by omitting the field, never
 *    by sending zero;
 *  - `currency` — exactly three upper-case letters, on every money field and on
 *    a cart's currency;
 *  - `qty` — a positive integer no greater than 10,000 (the shopper-facing cap,
 *    far tighter than the raw inventory primitive's);
 *  - `sku` — non-empty, and at most 200 characters where the entitlement check
 *    bounded it;
 *  - `buyerRef` — 1 to 320 characters; `couponCode` — 1 to 200; the login token —
 *    1 to 400; the shipping address — the per-field bounds the address schema
 *    pins, which the domain then re-validates and trims;
 *  - the physical dimensions and `initialOnHand` — integers (nullable where the
 *    schema allowed null), never floats;
 *  - the idempotency key — non-empty, which is what every write route demanded of
 *    the header.
 *
 * NOT mirrored, and why: the email on a login request is validated but never
 * REPORTED on — that surface answers identically whatever it is handed, so a
 * malformed address is a silent no-op rather than a refusal a caller could use as
 * an account oracle. Unknown-key rejection (the `.strict()` bodies) has no
 * meaning here: the port's inputs are typed, so an unknown field does not
 * compile, and there is no serialization for one to hide in.
 *
 * Every failure is {@link CommerceInputError} — an awaited rejection carrying a
 * structural `code`, the field and the reason. No status codes: there is no wire
 * here to carry one, and a caller branches on the code.
