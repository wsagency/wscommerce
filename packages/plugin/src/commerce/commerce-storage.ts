/**
 * The storage layout commerce truth lives in: every collection the
 * `@otta-sh/store-emdash` adapters read or write, with the indexes each one
 * declares.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ASSEMBLED HERE AND NOT IN THE ADAPTER PACKAGE. Each adapter module
 * owns the declaration for the collections it owns (`CART_COLLECTIONS`,
 * `ORDER_COLLECTIONS`, …) and the package deliberately publishes no union of
 * them: the union is a property of the DEPLOYMENT — which aggregates this
 * plugin actually holds — not of the adapters. The plugin is the deployment, so
 * the union is assembled here, by spreading the per-module constants rather than
 * by restating any collection name or index list. Nothing below may be typed out
 * by hand; a restated list is a list that drifts.
 *
 * A DECLARED INDEX IS A READ CONTRACT, not a performance knob: a `where` or
 * `orderBy` on a field the collection never declared is a runtime error, not a
 * slow query. That is why this list and the host descriptor's must be the same
 * object rather than two lists that happen to agree: the descriptor WILL import it
 * when the deployment flips to this transport, and until then this is the list the
 * test tiers bind their storage from.
 *
 * SANDBOX-CLEAN: type-only knowledge of the host, data only at runtime. Nothing
 * here executes host code, opens anything, or reads an environment.

 *
 * FROZEN, because as of INC-D1 this is public API handed out BY REFERENCE: the
 * deploying site's descriptor returns this very object as its `storage` block, so
 * any holder of it holds the schema every `collectionOf` is validated against, and
 * a collection deleted from it at runtime is a dead commerce path. `Readonly<>`
 * says so to the type checker only, and the site widens through a cast on the way

 * declarations are the adapter packages' own constants and are theirs to freeze.
