/**
 * The `CommerceClient` port (ADR-0002 §3 / plan §5): storefront routes and the
 * widget's save route depend on this INTERFACE, never on `fetch` directly.
 * `InProcessCommerceClient` (`src/commerce/in-process-commerce-client.ts`) is
 * now its only implementation — work order 02 folded the commerce service into
 * the plugin, and INC-D3a/D3b deleted the `ctx.http` adapter that used to be the
 * other one.
 *
 * ── WHY THE `*Wire` TYPES STAY (the INC-D3b call, to cost out at INC-D4) ──
 *
 * These interfaces, and the matching ones in `src/admin/*-surface.ts`, were
 * written to mirror the commerce service's JSON 1:1. That service is gone, so
 * nothing here mirrors anything over a network any more and the word "wire" is
 * HISTORICAL — it now just names the shape the plugin's own route handlers
 * return and the Block Kit renderers and storefront routes consume.
 *
 * They stay as they are. They are deliberately decoupled from the domain's
 * branded money (`Cents`) and its use-case result unions, and neither belongs in
 * presentation code: a Block Kit renderer that had to unwrap a branded scalar,
 * or a storefront route that had to narrow a domain result union, would be
 * carrying the domain's vocabulary into a layer whose job is to format strings.
 * The plugin's sandbox-cleanliness rule (no `@otta-sh/domain` import from these
 * modules) points the same way.
 *
 * INC-D4 should cost out only the NARROWER question: de-duplicating these
 * `*Wire` interfaces against the domain's READ MODELS, which are the shapes they
 * actually restate field-for-field. That is a real duplication with a real
 * maintenance cost, and it is a separate decision from "use domain types in the
 * plugin", which the paragraph above rejects. Nothing about it is required for
 * correctness today.
