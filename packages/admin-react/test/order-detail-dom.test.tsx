/**
 * @vitest-environment happy-dom
 *
 * The order detail screen, through a real mount of the real component.
 *
 * WHY A DOCUMENT. Everything below is decided inside the mounted screen and
 * nowhere else: the status cell is drawn from the loaded record, the money
 * surfaces sit behind a tab that only a click reaches, and the provider warning
 * is withdrawn by the panel's own mode rather than by anything a caller passes.
 * A static render of the isolated panel can state what the panel does with the
 * props it is handed; it cannot state that the SCREEN hands it those props, and
 * an inverted decision in the screen leaves such a suite entirely green.
 *
 * WHY THE ASSERTIONS ARE SCOPED TO THE FIELD OR THE TABLE THAT OWNS THE
 * DECISION. The detail mounts several `dl` strips, four tables and two dialogs,
 * and shares ids between them. A substring search over the markup answers
 * "somewhere on this screen" for a claim that is about one cell, which is how a
 * per-field decision gets a test that cannot tell fields apart.
 *
 * WHY THE FIXTURE'S FIGURES ALL CROSS A THOUSANDS SEPARATOR. An amount like
 * `1999` renders the same whether the formatter produced it or a call site
 * assembled `$` and a division by a hundred, so a fixture made of small amounts
 * cannot tell a formatted total from a hand-built one. Every amount here groups.
