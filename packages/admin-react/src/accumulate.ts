/**
 * What `Load more` does to the rows already on screen (F24).
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE. Both React lists used to assign the freshly
 * fetched page straight into list state, so a successful `Load more` REPLACED
 * the rows the operator was reading instead of adding to them. Nothing had to
 * fail for that to happen — the success path alone lost the page above. On
 * Pricing & inventory it is what made a low-stock scan useless: the matches the
 * operator had already gathered vanished at the exact moment they asked to see
 * more of them.
 *
 * MERGE ON IDENTITY, NEVER ON POSITION. The two requests are two statements
 * about a collection that keeps moving underneath them: a record inserted,
 * edited or re-sorted between them can appear on both pages, and blind
 * concatenation renders it twice — a duplicate row and, on React, a duplicate
 * key. So a row is matched by the id it is keyed and navigated by.
 *
 * TWO RULES, both deliberate:
 *
 *  - **Arrival order is preserved.** A row keeps the position it first
 *    appeared at, so the page an operator is mid-scan through does not reorder
 *    under them when the next one lands.
 *  - **The newer page wins on content.** A row that arrives again is the same
 *    record read more recently, so its fields replace the older read's — while
 *    keeping the older read's POSITION, per the rule above. A duplicate WITHIN
 *    one incoming page resolves the same way, last occurrence winning, because
 *    a page that names a record twice is the same disagreement in one response.
 *
 * PURE, and generic over the row, so both lists share the decision and it can
 * be tested as the function of `(accumulated, incoming)` that it is.

 * limit — every one of those failing closed to a 400 rather than to a 500 or to

 * on screen and re-derives their boundaries from the responses, which is exactly

 * exactly as stale as they were. So the screen could be made current, or it could
 * keep the operator's depth, and never both — which is not a state a panel write
 * can reconcile a row against.
 *
 * SO: RE-ASK THE QUESTIONS THAT PRODUCED WHAT IS ON SCREEN, IN ORDER. The window
 * opens on a page — page one for a walk that started there, the address's own
 * cursor for one that did not — and every page after it is reached by following
 * the nextCursor of the page before. That is a WALK, not a replay: only the
 * ANCHOR is a token this list already held; every boundary inside the window is
 * re-derived from the responses as they come back now.
 *
 * WHY NOT REPLAY THE HELD CURSORS INSTEAD, which would be one request per page
 * and could run them all at once. Because the held boundaries no longer line up
 * with each other the moment anything is inserted above them: page one re-read
 * under three new rows ends three rows EARLIER than the token that was minted
 * from its old tail, so the rows in between are covered by no request in the set
 * — a hole in the middle of the operator's window, silently. Re-deriving each
 * boundary from the response before it cannot produce a hole, because each page
 * begins exactly where the previous one ended. The cost is that the requests are

 * price of a window with nothing missing from it.
 *
 * THE ANCHOR IS WHY THIS IS NOT SIMPLY "WALK FROM PAGE ONE". A window that began
 * at a deep link has no page number ({@link pageNumber} refuses to invent one),
 * so walking `depth` pages from page one would land the operator on a different
 * set of rows entirely and caption it as a refresh of the ones they were reading.
 * An ungrounded walk is therefore anchored at the address's own cursor, which is
 * the same token a reload of that address would send.
 *
 * AND THE ANCHOR — NOT {@link grounded} — IS WHAT SAYS WHETHER THE FIRST RESPONSE
 * IS PAGE ONE. The two came apart in the first cut and it was a real defect: a
 * GROUNDED stack describes a walk that STARTED at page one, which is what makes
 * the page NUMBER knowable, and says nothing about where the window now sits. An
 * operator three `Next` presses in is grounded and standing on page three, so a
 * refresh anchored on page three's token that classified its answer as "page one"
 * would caption a deep page as the start of the collection: an empty answer would
 * claim the whole collection is empty, and a service that sends no `total` would
 * drop the page-scoped hedge and state those rows as the entire set. The wire
 * decides — a request that carried no token is page one, whoever asked for it —
 * exactly as it does for every other response these lists classify.

 * in `ui.tsx`. This function is the seam that turns the first into the second so
 * the third has nothing left to decide.
 *
 * `M` IS DERIVED, NEVER FETCHED. The service already counts the filtered set
 * alongside the page it returns, and the plugin already sends the keyset limit
 * it paged by, so the page count is arithmetic over two values this render is
 * holding — see `pageCount`. The `total` handed in must be the one the count
 * line ACTUALLY STATED (`listOutcome`'s `statedTotal`), not the raw payload
 * figure: that is what stops a page count appearing under a caption that
 * withheld the very number it was derived from.
 *
 * THE LAST PAGE IS THE PAGE COUNT — with one exception that is the whole reason
 * this is not a one-liner. A render whose response carried no next cursor has
 * DIRECT evidence of standing on the last page, and that outranks arithmetic
 * over two statements taken at different moments. But when the arithmetic says
 * there are MORE pages than the one being stood on, the two disagree outright,
 * and answering "Page 6 of 6" beside a count line reading "200 orders" would
 * pick a winner the render has no grounds to pick. It dashes instead: an
 * absence, rather than either of two figures that cannot both be true.
 *

 * both take the whole control away — the list knows about those, this function
 * does not — and everything else here is about whether there is anywhere to go.
 *
