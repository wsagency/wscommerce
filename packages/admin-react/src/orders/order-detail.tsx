/**
 * The React order detail.
 *
 * THE INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE IS THE BLOCK KIT ONE, deliberately and to the
 * block: an H1 naming the customer and the day, a back control, the notice, the
 * reconciliation alert, a six-entry identity strip, then four constant tabs —
 * `Order`, `Fulfilment`, `Money`, `History`. An operator moving between the two
 * screens during the migration must not have to relearn where anything is, and
 * §4's skeleton was argued out once already.
 *
 * WRITES GO BACK TO THE BLOCK KIT HANDLER, UNCHANGED. Every button here posts
 * the same `action_id` and the same `value` its Block Kit counterpart posts, and
 * the plugin forwards both to `orders-page.ts`'s action for that id. So the
 * watermark (`state`, `refundedSoFarCents`) the operator OBSERVED still rides
 * with the click and is still re-checked against live truth before anything is
 * written; the idempotency key is still content-derived and not a nonce; and
 * every refusal message an operator can see here was authored, budgeted and
 * suite-covered for the Block Kit screen. This file decides nothing about money.
 *
 * WHAT REPLACES THE STAGED "REVIEW" STEP. Block Kit's refund and cancel flows
 * are two-step (`…-review` stages the input server-side, then a confirm button
 * appears) because a Block Kit form cannot show a confirm dialog over the values
 * the operator just typed — the only way to put a reviewable summary in front of
 * them is a server round trip that re-renders the group. React can show the
 * dialog directly, so the review step collapses into the confirm: the operator
 * reads the SAME sentence, composed by the SAME shared
 * `refundConfirmText`, before anything is sent. Nothing is lost by the collapse,
 * because every validation the review step performed is performed again — server
 * side, against live truth — by the write handler itself. That is what makes the
 * shorter path safe rather than merely faster.
 *
 * EVERY AUTHORED STRING ON THIS SCREEN IS SHARED (INC-21). The first cut copied
 * roughly a dozen of them by hand from `orders-page.ts` and recorded a rider
 * saying so; closing it found FOUR places the two surfaces had already drifted
 * in the weeks between — typographic quotes, a shortened reconciliation note
 * that dropped its next step, an over-refund refusal that stated the fact but
 * not the instruction, and an additive-refunds warning whose "next step" clause
 * is true only on the surface that has one. `@otta-sh/admin-presentation`'s
 * `orders-copy.ts` records each. Nothing here authors copy any more; a string
 * that has to change changes once.

 *     looking up the caller-supplied `buyerRef` itself
 *     (`domain/src/orders/customer-context.ts`), so an "email" reached that

 *     second, independent source — the earlier cut of this function called
 *     that branch "verified" and skipped the clamp on it, which was the

 *     customer context could not be loaded, which is a NORMAL state (see

 *     rendering of `ABSENT` (the em dash) here. THE EM DASH IS NEVER A NOUN
 *     IN A SENTENCE: it is correct on the table cell and the heading, where
 *     it marks an empty FIELD, and wrong inside prose ("refund $42 to
 *     '—'?"), which reads as though "—" were the buyer's name rather than a
 *     marker for nothing being there. Keep this distinction — it is the
