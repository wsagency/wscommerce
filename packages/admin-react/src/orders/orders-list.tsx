/**
 * The React Orders list — the screen the whole migration exists for.
 *
 * WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE BLOCK KIT SCREEN, and it is a short list on
 * purpose. INC-20 is a migration, not a redesign: the columns, the status
 * words, the timestamps, the counts, the empty-state copy and the Period filter
 * are the finished Block Kit behaviour, rendered by different code. What React
 * buys, and all it is spent on here:
 *
 *  - **Row click** (`ADDENDUM §H`), absent from stock Block Kit at every version
 *    through 0.31.1 and the complaint this effort opened on.
 *  - **The copy button §1.3 wants** — the row shows a git-style short prefix and
 *    the button copies the FULL id. On Block Kit a table cell is a scalar with no
 *    per-cell affordance; that was the accepted degradation and this is it
 *    being repaid.
 *  - **No picker.** `Open order` is deleted, and with it the `ComboboxList`
 *    duplicate-key React error, which is picker-only.
 *  - **No round trip per interaction.** Opening an order is a state change, not
 *    a POST that replaces the whole block tree and loses the scroll position.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT DIFFERENT:
 *
 *  - **Sorting stays OFF** (§1.2). Not because React cannot sort — it trivially
 *    can — but because sort is not wired through `ListLevelDef.fetchPage` into
 *    the list ports, so a client-side sort would order the LOADED PAGE and
 *    silently present it as the order of the list. That is the same defect
 *    §1.2 rejects on Block Kit wearing better clothes.
 *  - **Filtering stays SERVER-SIDE**, for the same reason. ADR-0014 lists
 *    "client-side filter at zero network calls" among React's wins, and it is
 *    one — for a fully-loaded collection. This list is keyset-paged at 25, so a
 *    client-side filter would search the rows in hand and answer "no orders
 *    match" for an order that exists on page 2. The filter posts, exactly as it
 *    does today.

 * THE FIVE-OUTCOME LADDER IS NOT REIMPLEMENTED HERE (INC-20 review).
 *
 * The first cut of this file had two branches — "no rows and a filter is on" and
 * "no rows" — and hard-coded the Block Kit screen's copy beside them. That is
 * three defects in one shape, and a reviewer found all three:
 *
 *  1. A page-2 miss claimed **"No orders yet"**, a whole-collection claim this
 *     render has not earned. Page 1 had rows.
 *  2. Zero rows with a cursor still behind them rendered an empty state, which
 *     sat on top of `Load more` and **stranded the operator mid-scan** on a page
 *     that is not the end of anything. The Block Kit tier hit the same wall
 *     through a different mechanism (its renderer short-circuits a zero-row
 *     table carrying `empty_text` and takes the button with it) and answered it
 *     with the scan note this now renders.
 *  3. The count line used `String(count)` and an `s`, making it the one rendered
 *     value in this console a threaded locale would not reach.
 *
 * All three are what happens when a decision argued this carefully is written
 * twice. `listOutcome` and the copy constants come from
 * `@otta-sh/admin-presentation`; both surfaces make the SAME call with the same
 * inputs and differ only in how they draw the answer.
