/**
 * The `/orders` console page — list or detail, and the navigation between them.
 *
 * THE DRILL-IN HAS A URL, which is the whole difference from the Block Kit
 * screen. There, "no client routing, no URL per drill-in, back is a rendered
 * button" (§0.5): every interaction POSTs and replaces the entire block tree, so
 * an order's detail is a transient render with no address. Here the selected
 * order lives in the query string, so a browser Back goes back, a reload lands
 * where the operator was, and an order can be sent to a colleague as a link.
 *
 * WHY A QUERY PARAMETER RATHER THAN A PATH SEGMENT. EmDash's admin router
 * resolves a plugin page by matching the derived path against the descriptor's
 * declared `adminPages`; `/orders/<uuid>` is not a declared page and would
 * resolve no component at all. `?order=<uuid>` stays on the declared `/orders`
 * page while still being a real, shareable, back-navigable address.
 *
 * `popstate` IS LISTENED TO, AND THE STATE IS STILL THE SOURCE OF TRUTH. The
 * admin SPA has its own router; rather than reach into it, this component pushes
 * history entries and reads them back, and renders from its own state either
 * way. If a future EmDash intercepts the history in a way that stops the
 * listener firing, the screen still works — it loses the browser Back button,
 * not the navigation.
 *
 * THE FILTER, THE TAB AND THE PAGE ARE ALL IN THE ADDRESS (F22, F23), and
 * their plumbing lives here rather than in the list and the detail for one
 * reason: this is the file that already touches `window.history`, and a screen
 * with two writers to the same address bar is a screen whose URL and rendered
 * state drift. The list and the detail ANNOUNCE a change and are TOLD what to
 * start from; neither reads or writes history itself.
