 * The console's shared presentation primitives.

 * NO COMPONENT LIBRARY, still. INC-19 measured `@cloudflare/kumo` and

 * adopting either as "a deliberate new coupling to an unpinned component
 * library, not a requirement". Nothing here changes that: `react` and `emdash`
 * remain this package's only peers.
 *
 * TWO RULES GOVERN EVERY STYLE IN THIS FILE.
 *
 *  1. **Theme-neutral.** The admin ships light and dark, and a fixed foreground
 *     or background colour is legible in exactly one of them. Everything is
 *     `currentColor`, `transparent`, or a grey stated as an alpha over whatever
 *     is behind it. The three accent colours are used for BORDERS and never as
 *     text or fill, so they never have to contrast with a background this file
 *     does not control.
 *  2. **Logical properties (G6).** `marginBlockEnd`, `borderInlineStart`,
 *     `textAlign: "start"` — the admin is RTL-capable and nothing here may pin
 *     to the left.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS A STYLESHEET AND NOT ONLY INLINE STYLES. Two things this screen
 * is required to have cannot be expressed as a style object: `:focus-visible`
 * (the DoD includes a focus-state screenshot, and every interactive element
 * needs a visible ring) and `:hover` on a table row (DESIGNER §8's full-row
 * hover tint, which is what makes a link in one cell read as "this row opens").
 * Both are pseudo-classes. The sheet is minimal and mounted once.

/**
 * THE LOOK OF A CONTROL THAT IS PRESENT BUT CANNOT BE USED.
 *
 * TWO OVERCORRECTIONS, AND THIS IS THE MIDDLE. The first cut dropped the whole
 * button to `opacity: 0.45`, which took the 13px LABEL down with the border and
 * left a word a low-vision operator had to work to read. The second went the
 * other way — a near-invisible border and a token opacity — and made unavailable
 * and live nearly indistinguishable, which is worse: a control that looks
 * pressable and does nothing.
 *
 * SO THE STATE IS CARRIED BY THREE DECLARATIONS, and the point is WHICH of them
 * loses strength. A flat fill (the surface reads as inert rather than raised), a
 * border visibly lighter than {@link HAIRLINE} but still THERE, and a label
 * mixed down to 62% of the theme's own foreground.
 *
 * THE MIX IS AN ALPHA — that is exactly what `color-mix(…, transparent)` is, and
 * claiming otherwise would be dressing up the same technique in better words.
 * What makes it different from the `opacity` it replaces is WHERE it lands:
 * `opacity` fades the whole element, so the border and the fill that carry the
 * state fade at precisely the rate the label does, and the only way to keep the
 * state visible is to keep the label legible or vice versa. Here the fill and the
 * border stay at full strength and only the word is muted, so the two jobs stop
 * competing. 62% clears the contrast floor at this size while reading
 * unmistakably as "off"; it is stated against `currentColor` so it follows the
 * theme rather than pinning a grey that is legible in one of them.
 *
 * A whole `border` rather than a `border-color`: `buttonStyle` states the
 * shorthand, and React warns (correctly) that mixing the two on one element

/**
 * The stylesheet, mounted once by the screen.

 * `:focus-visible` rather than `:focus` is deliberate: a mouse click on a button

 * The ring uses `outline` (not `border`) so it never reflows the control it is
 * on, and `outline-offset` keeps it clear of the element's own hairline.
 *
 * `.otta-link` IS WHY A DRILL-IN LOOKS LIKE ONE, and its whole reason for being
 * in the sheet rather than in a style object is that its states are pseudo-class
 * states: the rule under the word goes SOLID on `:hover` and on
 * `:focus-visible`. An inline `text-decoration-color` outranks both of those
 * triggers — the same trap `.otta-copy-reveal` documents for `opacity` — so the
 * colour is the sheet's, not the call site's. Both lists reach that solid state
 * through this one rule.
 *
 * ROW HOVER IS A THIRD TRIGGER AND IT BELONGS TO ONE LIST. F18 asks for it on
 * the Pricing title only — "the title link stays undecorated at rest and
 * underlines on row hover" — so it hangs off `.otta-link-row`, a modifier that
 * only that call site carries. Widening the selector back to `.otta-link` would
 * put a rule under the Orders prefix whenever a pointer crossed its row, which
 * is a state that item does not ask for.
 *
 * The REST state is the other thing the two lists differ on, and that too is the
 * item's wording rather than a house preference: the Orders prefix takes a muted
 * rule at 2px offset (its call site adds `text-decoration-line`), while the
 * Pricing title stays undecorated and takes this class's own `none`.

 * rather than in a list because both lists rendered it verbatim: two copies of a
 * control whose accessibility is the interesting part is two copies that drift.
 *
 * `aria-disabled` RATHER THAN `disabled`, which is the whole reason this is not

 * list, with no ring to find. So it keeps its tab stop and its focus ring,
 * announces itself as unavailable, and refuses its own click.
 *
 * THE REASON IS A VISUALLY-HIDDEN SENTENCE, referenced by `aria-describedby`,
 * and `title` is a bonus rather than the mechanism. The earlier version had this
 * exactly backwards — it claimed `title` was what a keyboard user could reach,
 * which is the one thing `title` is NOT: a tooltip is a POINTER affordance,
 * shown on hover, and keyboard exposure of it is inconsistent across browsers
 * and screen readers. A described-by node is read out with the control's name
 * every time, by every screen reader, whether the operator arrived by pointer,
 * by tab, or by a rotor listing of the page's buttons.

 * screen means pasting an order id into a refund. The label flips to `Copied` on
 * success and to `Press ⌘C` on failure — the clipboard API is
 * permission-gated and origin-gated and can simply say no, and a silent failure
 * there is the worst of the three outcomes.
 *
 * THE FALLBACK HAS TO BE REACHABLE, and in the first cut it was not. On a
 * non-secure origin `navigator.clipboard` is UNDEFINED, so `.writeText(...)`
 * throws a synchronous `TypeError` before a promise exists — `.catch()` never
 * runs, the failure escapes as an unhandled error, and the label stays `Copy`.
 * That is precisely the plain-HTTP staging box an operator is most likely to be

 *  - NO ROW. Clicks land on padding and on the table body itself.
 *  - A LIVE SELECTION INSIDE THE ROW. A merchant drag-selecting a SKU is
 *    finishing a selection, not opening an order.
 *  - A PRESS THAT MOVED. Same intent, caught earlier: a drag that started on the
 *    row is a drag even before the selection settles. An absent origin is also a
 *    bail — a click with no press behind it is not one this row saw begin. The
