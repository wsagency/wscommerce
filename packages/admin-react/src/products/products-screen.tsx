/**
 * The `/products` console page — list or detail, and the navigation between
 * them (INC-21).
 *
 * THE DRILL-IN HAS A URL, which is the whole difference from the Block Kit
 * screen. There, "no client routing, no URL per drill-in, back is a rendered
 * button" (§0.5): every interaction POSTs and replaces the entire block tree, so
 * a product's detail is a transient render with no address. Here the selected
 * product lives in the query string, so a browser Back goes back, a reload lands
 * where the merchant was, and a product can be sent to a colleague as a link —
 * which on THIS screen is what a "please reprice this" message has always
 * needed and never had.
 *
 * WHY A QUERY PARAMETER RATHER THAN A PATH SEGMENT. EmDash's admin router
 * resolves a plugin page by matching the derived path against the descriptor's
 * declared `adminPages`; `/products/<uuid>` is not a declared page and would
 * resolve no component at all. `?product=<uuid>` stays on the declared
 * `/products` page while still being a real, shareable, back-navigable address.
 *
 * IT IS THE SAME MECHANISM `orders-screen.tsx` USES, deliberately and to the
 * line: the same push-on-drill, the same pop-on-back, the same guard for an
 * operator who arrived on a pasted link with nothing of ours to pop, and the
 * same filter and tab plumbing. Two screens' navigation behaving differently is
 * the kind of difference nobody documents and everybody trips on. The parameter
 * names differ, and — because only this screen has forms that hold typed work —
 * the unsaved-work guard below.

			 *
			 * THE CASE THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER: a `popstate` that lands on

			 * guard by design and falls through to the remount below, discarding that
			 * work with no confirmation. This console cannot produce that case on its
			 * own, and the enumeration is FOUR items now rather than three: the
			 * drill-in pushes exactly one entry above the list entry; a filter or tab
			 * change replaces rather than pushes; a PAGE change pushes, but only ever
			 * from the LIST, where no record is on screen and every entry it creates
			 * therefore names none; and this guard's own re-push truncates anything
			 * ahead of it. So reaching the uncovered case would still require a host
			 * router pushing its own entry that names this same record. Not changing
			 * the guard to close it; noted here for whoever changes the navigation
			 * around it next.
			 *
			 * A traversal that leaves the DOCUMENT is not covered here — nothing is
			 * delivered to a document being torn down — and is covered by the
			 * `beforeunload` above instead.
