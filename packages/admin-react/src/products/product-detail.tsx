/**
 * The React product detail (INC-21).
 *
 * THE INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE IS THE BLOCK KIT ONE, to the block: an H1
 * carrying the product's title, a back control, the notice, the tombstone
 * alert, a four-entry identity strip, then two constant tabs — `Product` and
 * `Stock`. An operator moving between the two screens during the migration must
 * not have to relearn where anything is, and §4's skeleton was argued out once
 * already.
 *
 * WRITES GO BACK TO THE BLOCK KIT HANDLERS, UNCHANGED. Every control here posts
 * the same `action_id` and the same payload its Block Kit counterpart posts;
 * the plugin re-assembles the `form_submit` carrier those handlers read and
 * forwards it. So `expectedUpdatedAt` still rides with a save and is still
 * enforced by the service's optimistic concurrency, the `onHand` watermark
 * still rides with a stock movement and is still re-read against live truth,
 * the idempotency keys are still content-derived and not nonces, and every
 * refusal message an operator can see here was authored, budgeted and
 * suite-covered for the Block Kit screen. This file decides nothing about stock
 * and nothing about money.
 *
 * G2 / ADR-0013 IS ASSERTED HERE, NOT ONLY INHERITED. There is no Title field
 * and no Status field on this screen, on EITHER surface: `product_commerce.title`
 * is a CMS-owned single-writer cache and `active` is the CMS's publish gate, so
 * both render as text and neither is editable. The Block Kit screen enforces
 * that structurally — `ProductEditWire` has no `title` or `active` member, so a
 * form field for one does not compile. The React screen sends a payload of
 * plain strings and gets no such compile error, which is exactly why a
 * Playwright spec asserts the absence directly (`products-console.spec.ts`)
 * rather than trusting this comment.
 *
 * WHAT REPLACES THE STAGED "REVIEW" STEP for a stock removal: the same collapse
 * INC-20 made for refunds. Block Kit stages the typed quantity server-side and
 * renders a confirm button on a second render, because a Block Kit form cannot
 * show a dialog over the values the operator just typed. React can, so the
 * operator reads the SAME sentence — composed by the SAME shared
 * `removeStockConfirm` — before anything is sent. Nothing is lost, because
 * every check the review step performed is performed again, server-side against
 * live truth, by the write handler: the watermark comparison, and then the
 * service's own guarded decrement, which refuses an over-removal cleanly rather
 * than going negative.

/**
 * The Price group: price, an optional currency, compare-at and unit cost — the
 * four fields that must co-reside because they all read the product's one
 * currency — and the four states a save can be in.
 *
 * IT OWNS ITS OWN `Group`, which is what lets a SHUT group say it is holding
 * work: the ` · unsaved` marker belongs on the summary line, and the dirty state
 * that decides it lives with the fields. Nothing is lifted out of this component
 * and nothing is stored for it.
 *
 * FOUR STATES, NO MODAL. An ordinary price edit is still one click — routing
 * every save through a confirm dialog taxes the correct edits to guard the rare
 * one, and answers nothing about what happened afterwards. What the save gains
 * instead is a BEFORE (the pending block naming both amounts, a warn border on
 * what changed, and a way to discard) and an AFTER (a receipt that names the
 * amounts and does not fade). `Save` is disabled while clean, because a clean
 * save is a no-op that still bumps `updatedAt` — a silent write that will make
 * the next operator's optimistic-concurrency check fail for no reason.
 *
 * NO AMOUNT IS ASSEMBLED HERE. The after-amount goes through the same
 * `parseMinorUnitsInput` the write itself does, and both ends of the arrow are
 * rendered by the shared money formatter; the component holds integer minor
 * units and strings, and never a float.
 *
 * CURRENCY IS NEVER A FIXED SINGLE-OPTION SELECT (F-3). For an ALREADY-PRICED
 * product the currency cannot change here, so it is submitted invisibly and no
 * control is rendered for it; only a first-time pricing renders a real input.
 *
 * BLANK IS PRESERVED AS BLANK, and the distinction is the whole of what these
 * fields mean. A blank PRICE leaves the price unchanged; a blank COMPARE-AT or
 * UNIT COST CLEARS it. Both are the Block Kit screen's behaviour, both are
 * implemented by the same `buildEditWire` on the other side, and neither is
 * decided here — this form's only job is not to turn a null into `"0.00"` on
 * the way in.

 * BOTH MOVEMENTS NOW CONFIRM (F5), and the reconciliation went upward on

 * gates for no stated reason; levelling DOWN would have deleted the only
 * safeguard on the screen's one destructive act, and the addition is in fact the
 * more dangerous typo — an over-add lets the store sell units it does not have,
 * where an over-remove only costs sales. What each dialog is FOR is restating
 * the parsed quantity, which is the one failure the field cannot catch.
 *
 * WHAT STILL DISTINGUISHES THEM, because a shared gate must not make two
 * different acts look alike: `Remove stock` is the screen's ONE destructive act
 * (DA-5's second exception — a removal is reversible only by a separate,
 * forgettable manual operation), so it keeps its alert banner, its danger
 * styling and the consequence in its group label. `Add stock` has none of those
 * — with ONE exception this panel does not control: the shared confirm dialog
 * styles its confirm button as destructive for every caller, so `Yes, add …`
 * currently reads in the same ink as `Yes, remove …`. That is the dialog's to
 * fix, not this panel's, and until it is fixed the distinction above holds
 * everywhere except on that one button.
