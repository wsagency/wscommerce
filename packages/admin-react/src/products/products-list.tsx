/**
 * The React Pricing & inventory list — INC-21, and the second and last screen
 * ADR-0014 migrates.
 *
 * WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE BLOCK KIT SCREEN, and it is the same short list
 * INC-20's Orders list carries, because this is a migration and not a redesign:
 *
 *  - **Row click.** The title cell is a link to the product's detail and the
 *    whole row is a target (DESIGNER §8), through ONE delegated listener on the
 *    table body. A selection guard is what keeps the second column — a code an
 *    operator pastes into a spreadsheet — selectable rather than dead.
 *  - **No picker.** `Open product` is deleted, and with it the `ComboboxList`
 *    duplicate-key React error, which is picker-only.
 *  - **A copy button on the SKU.** See the identity note below.
 *  - **No round trip per interaction.** Opening a product is a state change,
 *    not a POST that replaces the whole block tree.
 *
 * THE IDENTITY RULING, because §1.3 reads differently on this screen than on
 * Orders and the difference is load-bearing.
 *
 * §1.3 governs OPAQUE ids and says in as many words that "Orders is the only
 * screen showing an opaque uuid". This one shows none: the product uuid lives
 * in `option.value` on the Block Kit picker and in the drill path, and is
 * rendered nowhere. What identifies a row to an operator is the **SKU** — a
 * natural key, the thing low stock is reported by, the thing a purchase order
 * is written against — and §1.3 exempts natural keys explicitly (it makes the
 * same call for Tax and Shipping's slug ids and for Coupons' `Code`). So the
 * SKU renders IN FULL, with no prefix and no truncation, and the React tier's
 * contribution is the copy button beside it rather than a short-id scheme this
 * screen has no use for. Applying the prefix rule here would shorten the one
 * value on the row that an operator has to read whole.
 *
 * The uuid is still on the row — in the link's `href` and its `data-product-id`
 * — because that is what navigates. It is not rendered.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT DIFFERENT:
 *
 *  - **Sorting stays OFF** (§1.2): sort is not wired through
 *    `ListLevelDef.fetchPage` into the list ports, so a client-side sort would
 *    order the LOADED PAGE and silently present it as the order of the list.
 *  - **Filtering stays SERVER-SIDE**, keyset-paged at 25 — "Low stock only"
 *    included. It USED TO be the one exception: the service's products list
 *    had no stock predicate, so the plugin narrowed the fetched page itself
 *    and withheld the `total` (the service's count described a different set
 *    of rows than the ones on screen). It is a real predicate now — the
 *    plugin resolves the store's threshold and carries it on the request the
 *    same as every other filter — so `Load more` is a genuine next page, the
 *    `total` (when the plugin can resolve one) DESCRIBES the rows on screen
 *    and is shown, and `countScope` is unconditionally `"service-filtered"`
 *    below. The one thing that can still go wrong is the threshold itself
 *    being unreadable, in which case the plugin sends no predicate at all and
 *    says so via `stock.filterUnavailable` — see `narrowed` below.

 * filter change and a first mount.
 *

 * on an `extend` the rows merge by id (see {@link mergeById}) and `firstPage` is
 * inherited, because a scan that began at the first page still starts there
 * after its second page lands.
 *
 * `filterUnavailable` IS THE ONE EXCEPTION, AND IT LATCHES ACROSS BOTH KINDS OF
 * CONTINUATION — the long argument is at the branch itself.
 *
 * `unreadable` DOES NOT LATCH, deliberately. It describes how the newest

	 * the merchant's low-stock filter ever applied to what you are looking at",
	 * and only PAGE ONE can answer it. Every request carrying a cursor reports
	 * `false` by contract (`resolveStockContext`'s decision 3), because the
	 * predicate rode inside the opaque token and the plugin has nothing to
	 * re-check. So a continuation has NO answer of its own — `false` there means
	 * "not asked", not "the filter ran".
	 *
	 * The first cut inherited the latch only on an `extend`, on the reasoning that
	 * a replaced window is a single page and a single page speaks for itself. It
	 * does not: `Next` from a first page whose threshold could not be read sends a
	 * cursor exactly like `Load more` does, gets the same contractual `false`
	 * back, and would drop the banner and start captioning every product in the
	 * catalog as low stock — at the click of a control that has nothing to do with
	 * filtering. The latch therefore rides on the CONTINUATION, not on the merge.
	 *
	 * AND ONLY ON A CONTINUATION. A request that put no cursor on the wire —
	 * `Previous` off the bottom of the stack as much as a filter apply — is page
	 * one, answered authoritatively, and arrives as a `reset` above: it may clear
	 * a stale banner and it may raise a fresh one. Latching there would have been
	 * the same defect pointing the other way, with a banner nothing could ever
	 * dismiss.
	 *
	 * KNOWN LIMIT, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN: a continuation with NOTHING BEHIND
	 * IT — a page deep-linked straight from an address — has no page-one answer to
	 * inherit, so it takes the contractual `false` at face value and shows no
	 * banner even if the threshold is unreadable. The screen cannot do better
	 * without a second request it has no reason to make: the fact simply is not on
	 * the wire for that page. It self-corrects the moment the merchant pages back
	 * to the first page or applies a filter.
	 *
	 * THE `total` GOES WITH IT for page one's own reason: the count that arrives
	 * is the count of every product while the merchant asked for the low-stock
	 * ones, so honouring it would put a confident exact number under a banner
	 * saying the filter was skipped.

 * BEHIND one that succeeded disproves none of the rows above it, and clearing
 * them would throw away a low-stock scan the merchant may have spent several
 * pages building.
 *
 * THE CURSOR STAYS TOO, and taking it was a defect rather than tidiness. A
 * cursor is this render's evidence that the collection continues past the rows
 * on screen, and a failed attempt to follow it does not disprove that. Nulling
 * it flipped `hasNext` false, which flipped the outcome to a completed scan,

 * "6 low-stock products loaded so far" into "6 low-stock products", a
 * whole-set claim made at the exact moment the render knows another page is
 * out there. Reachable whenever no `total` is on the response to carry the
 * claim instead — a service older than `total`, or a page the low-stock filter
 * could not be applied to. Worse at zero rows: a zero-row page with a cursor
 * behind it turned from a scan note with paging still offered into an empty
 * state offering `Clear filters`, dead-ending the scan.
 *

 * a notice already carrying the Retry for the same request; the retry re-runs
