/**
 * The console's ONE data path, and the wire shapes it speaks (INC-20).
 *
 * ADR-0014 Decision 3: `otta-console` holds zero capabilities and zero
 * `allowedHosts`, owns no routes, and reaches commerce ONLY by calling the
 * existing authenticated `otta` admin route from the browser with the operator's
 * own session. Everything in this module goes through that one route, through
 * `apiFetch` (which adds the `X-EmDash-Request` CSRF header state-changing
 * endpoints require), same-origin. There is no second fetch anywhere in this
 * package, and there must never be one.
 *
 * WIRE TYPES ARE MIRRORED, NOT IMPORTED, and for the same reason
 * `packages/plugin/src/types.ts` hand-mirrors EmDash's plugin surface: the
 * console may not import `@otta-sh/plugin`
 * (`console-imports-no-workspace-package`), so the shapes below are this
 * package's own statement of what it expects to receive. They are structural
 * subsets — every field here is read by a component; fields the plugin sends and
 * the console does not use are deliberately absent rather than mirrored for
 * completeness, so this file stays a description of THIS screen's needs.
 *
 * FAILURES ARE VALUES (G5, one tier up). Nothing here throws at a component. A
 * 401 (a session that expired in another tab) and a 403 (a role that lost
 * `plugins:manage`) are the two most likely things this page will ever see in
 * production, and both must reach the screen as a sentence, not as a blank pane.
 * INC-19 stated the status and recorded the remediation copy as deferred to this
 * increment; {@link readFailure} is where it lands, built on EmDash's own
 * `getErrorMessage` so the server's message is what the operator reads.
