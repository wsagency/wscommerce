/**
 * The crash tier: every window `EmdashInventoryStore` has, opened deliberately on
 * REAL storage, and proved to heal with exactly-once semantics.
 *
 * How a seam is built here, and why it is built this way:
 *
 * 1. A real storage collection is wrapped by `test/helpers/fault-injection.ts`.
 *    The wrapper delegates every method to the real repository; it only parks a
 *    chosen call or throws on it. Nothing is faked, so the document the replay
 *    heals is the document the host would really have left behind.
 * 2. A crash is `failCall(…, { mode: "after" })` or `{ mode: "instead" }` — the
 *    preceding write lands for real, and the continuation is lost. Every case
 *    **reads the documents back** before replaying, so "A durably landed" is
 *    asserted, not assumed.
 * 3. Then the replay runs on a CLEAN store, and the case asserts the heal: one
 *    hold, one decrement, one recorded answer, and the same reservation id.
 * 4. Every case carries the assertion that would FAIL if the write order were
 *    reversed. Those assertions are the point of the file; a case that only
 *    proved "a replay works" would pass under the forbidden order too.
 *
 * Seam (h) — a late same-key caller arriving after the hold was committed and
 * pruned — is NOT duplicated here: it is the gated case
 * "refuses to write a second hold when a peer's hold was committed and pruned
 * mid-flight" in `inventory-store-contract.dialects.test.ts`, which opens the same
 * window with the same helper.
 *
 * The contention budget at the bottom is Postgres-only, for the reason the race
 * suite states: one process over better-sqlite3 serializes writers and can never
 * make a compare-and-set lose.

/**
 * The asserted contention budget for a compare-and-set step on one hot inventory
 * aggregate — a **permanent** budget, because R2 has no structural fix: the
 * aggregate is written by read-modify-write and will retry under load.
 *
 * It is set from measurement plus headroom, and it is deliberately STRICTLY below
 * {@link CAS_MAX_ATTEMPTS}: a run that merely reached the ceiling would mean some
 * shopper was one lost race away from a retryable failure. Measured on the two
 * shapes the budget suite runs (M units, N concurrent single-unit reserves):
 *
 * | shape | measured max attempts |
 * |---|---|
 * | M=5, N=50, 20 loops | 5–6 across repeated runs |
 * | M=1, N=100, 1 loop | 2 |
 *
 * The depth tracks M, not N — only M writes can ever succeed before the guard
 * turns every remaining caller into a clean `OUT_OF_STOCK` with no write at all, so
 * the worst case is M+1 attempts (lose M times, then win), which is what both rows
 * show. A crowd ten times larger does not move the number; more UNITS on
 * one hot sku would.
 *
 * That is also the honest limit of this budget: it covers the shapes where the
 * writes are bounded by the units. The merchant shape in
 * `restock-concurrency.pg.test.ts` — twenty guarded removals racing twenty reserves
 * on one document, where a REFUSED removal still writes its ledger entry — does
 * reach {@link CAS_MAX_ATTEMPTS} and does surface typed retryable failures; that
 * case asserts the invariants that survive them (no over-consumption, exact
 * conservation, never negative) and reports the count, because a contention failure
 * writes nothing.
 *
 * Raising this constant is a change to the budget: measure first, then move it, and
 * update the table above and the package README together.
