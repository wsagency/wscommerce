/**
 * The crash seams, on **D1**.
 *
 * **What this file is, and what it is not.** INC-A3's crash tier lives in
 * `test/inventory-crash-seams.dialects.test.ts` — eighteen cases across seven
 * seams. That file CANNOT be run over this harness unchanged, and the reason is
 * structural rather than semantic: its suite body is a closure passed to
 * `describeEachDialect`, and that module imports `better-sqlite3` and `pg` at
 * module scope, neither of which exists inside `workerd`. Importing it here fails
 * before a case runs, and the body is not exported separately. Making the whole
 * suite dialect-portable means splitting the Node harness into a driver-agnostic
 * binder plus two driver modules, which is a change to the Node tiers and belongs
 * in its own change rather than riding along with this one.
 *
 * So this file ports the seams whose failure would be a DIALECT failure rather
 * than a logic failure, chosen so that every distinct mechanism the crash tier
 * relies on is exercised at least once on D1:
 *
 * - **(a)** and **(c)** — `failCall` in `"instead"` mode: a real write lands, the
 *   next one throws. Between them they cover both write shapes on the key
 *   document, a create (`expectedRevision === null`) and an update.
 * - **(e)** — `parkCall`: a real call held open while the test observes the
 *   intermediate state. Ordering — the terminal answer before the prune — is
 *   tested nowhere else, and this is also the one case that proves a
 *   partially-applied D1 write sequence is observable at all.
 * - **(g)** — the cross-SKU `commitMany` path, three aggregates in one batch, with
 *   the crash landing on the second. Per-SKU durability across a batch is a
 *   property of how the adapter sequences statements, and D1 is the dialect where
 *   "no transaction spans the batch" is literally true.
 *
 * Seams (b), (d-release), (f) and (g-adoptMany) are NOT ported. They exercise the
 * same two injection mechanisms over the same primitives on different documents;
 * once the primitives are proved on D1 (`storage-access.d1.spec.ts`) and the
 * mechanisms are proved here, what those cases add is logic coverage, which the
 * Node tiers already give on every commit. They are named here so the gap is a
 * recorded decision rather than a silent omission.
