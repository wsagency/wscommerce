/**
 * THE cart-layer acceptance gate, on the document adapter. `@otta-sh/store-postgres`
 * is gone; this is the pg-tier coverage now, re-pointed at `EmdashCartStore`. Postgres only:
 * better-sqlite3 serializes writes in one process, so it verifies the shape and
 * never the contention.
 *
 * N concurrent add-to-cart requests against stock M (N > M) must never oversell:
 * exactly M carts get a line, N−M get `OUT_OF_STOCK` after any typed busy commands
 * recover with their original keys, and the final count is 0.
 * The guarantee has to survive the CART layer, not just the reserve port, which is
 * what separates this file from `no-oversell.pg.test.ts`.
 *
 * The M/N/loop numbers and the four original assertions are unchanged. Three
 * assertions are ADDED, because the document model makes them checkable:
 *
 * - every winning cart's add mutation ends `completed` — a line whose ledger entry
 *   is still a claim would mean the completion bracket tore;
 * - the aggregate holds exactly M holds — no orphan reservation was left behind by
 *   a loser;
 * - the units are conserved: `onHand` plus the held units equals M.
 *
 * The pool is sized so each of the N callers can hold its OWN connection; a pool
 * narrower than the crowd serializes the writers and weakens the race, which is
 * why this file builds its own storage instead of taking the shared one.
