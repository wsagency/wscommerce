/**
 * The order store's rollup hook: what it emits, when, and what it must never do to
 * the transition it follows.
 *
 * The hook is the only edit the reporting adapter makes to another store, and it is
 * additive by construction — one call after the order write is DURABLE, with the
 * payload a bucket needs (which order, in what currency, created when, leaving
 * which state for which, carrying what total; and for a refund, which refund and
 * how much). Three properties are load-bearing and each has a case here:
 *
 *  - **Exactly once per won write.** The flip runs inside a compare-and-set retry
 *    loop, so a hook inside the loop body would fire once per attempt; a LOST flip
 *    (the second caller of `markPaid`) wrote nothing and owes no event at all.
 *  - **After durability.** The event describes a state that is already committed,
 *    so a rollup built from it can never claim a transition the orders disagree with.
 *  - **Never fatal.** Reporting is derived data. A writer that throws must leave the
 *    transition committed, the order readable, and the caller's answer unchanged —
 *    the recompute is what makes the counters exact again.
