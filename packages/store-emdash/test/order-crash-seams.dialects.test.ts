/**
 * The order store's crash seams, fault-injected over **real** storage.
 *
 * Every case here parks or fails ONE real write and then reads the documents back,
 * so what a replay heals is the state the store really leaves behind rather than a
 * state a mock was told to report. The seams are exactly the windows the document
 * model has, and there are eleven of them (fourteen cases — three seams are opened from
 * two sides each):
 *
 * 1. **The key claim landed, the order document did not.** The one window creation
 *    has. Any replayer finishes it from the payload the claim carries — including
 *    the line ids, which is why the payload is the whole prepared document.
 * 2. **The order document landed, the key was not promoted.** The reverse half, and
 *    the reason the promotion is LAST: a terminal key over a missing order would
 *    read as "already minted" and lose the checkout.
 * 3. **A partial `adoptMany` across three SKUs.** Cross-SKU work is N writes, not an
 *    atom; the adoption intent on the order document is what makes the partial set
 *    completable, and the per-SKU write is idempotent by reservation id.
 * 4. **A partial commit, completed by the SINGULAR `commit` per id.** `commitMany`
 *    skips an already-`committed` id (ADR-0019 §2), so re-running the batch is NOT
 *    the completion — the per-id call is.
 * 5. **The transition is one write.** Parked, the flip, the audit event and the
 *    outbox entry are ALL absent; released, all three are present. That is the
 *    atomicity statement the SQL adapter got from a transaction, and parking the
 *    single compare-and-set is a stronger check than aborting one would be.
 * 6. **Expiry crashing after the flip, and after one release.** The release intent
 *    survives the crash, and completing it returns the units EXACTLY once.
 * 7. **A refund claim landed, the order's compare-and-set did not.** The refund's
 *    own window, and the reason `refund_keys` carries the whole prepared row: the
 *    replay completes it with the SAME refund id rather than reserving twice.
 * 8. **A reserve landed, the finalize crashed** — the status-guarded finalize
 *    completes exactly once, and a void after a crashed void releases the capacity
 *    exactly once (never twice, never not at all).
 * 9. **A cancellation flipped, its release crashed.** The same shape as expiry's,
 *    through the cancel path: the intent survives and the units come back once.
 * 10. **The order document landed, its DERIVED by-sku index documents did not.** The
 *    search's line-sku arm IS those documents, so the window is "the order exists and
 *    cannot be found by the sku it bought". Any resolve of the key re-asserts them, and
 *    because each is create-if-absent on the `(sku, orderId)` pair, the heal writes one
 *    document however many times it runs.
 * 11. **The outbox entry landed, its LOCATOR did not.** The locator is a second
 *    document written after the flip, so this is the one tear the settle path has. It
 *    HEALS rather than failing: a claimed entry is in the `emailDueAt` index by
 *    construction, so one bounded walk finds it and writes the locator, and the next
 *    settle is a `get` again.
