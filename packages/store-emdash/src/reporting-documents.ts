/**
 * The reporting documents: one precomputed counter set per (currency, UTC day), and
 * one claim per rollup event.
 *
 * The SQL computed every report on READ — one statement over `orders`,
 * `order_totals`, `order_items` and `refunds`, with the period bucket as a
 * dialect-branched `date_trunc`. A plugin has no join, no `GROUP BY` and no raw SQL,
 * so two of the four reports move to WRITE time and become documents:
 *
 * | Document | What it is |
 * |---|---|
 * | `reporting_daily/{currency}:{YYYY-MM-DD}` | the orders CREATED that UTC day in that currency: how many sit in each state, how much of it counts as revenue, and how much came back |
 * | `reporting_applied/{claim}` | one rollup event's claim — what makes a redelivered event a no-op |
 *
 * **The day is the grain, and the other two intervals are folds over it.** A week is
 * the seven day documents from its ISO Monday and a month is its own days, so nothing
 * is keyed by a week or a month and no second aggregate can disagree with the first.
 * That is only sound because every boundary here is UTC and every coarser bucket is a
 * union of whole UTC days — which is exactly what the SQL's `date_trunc(…, AT TIME
 * ZONE 'UTC')` and `strftime(…)` computed, so the fold and the statement agree by
 * construction rather than by testing.
 *
 * **The bucket is keyed on the order's CREATION day, never on the day anything
 * happened to it.** A transition on an order created three months ago moves
 * three-month-old counters, and a refund issued today lands in the day the order was
 * placed. Both follow from the port: revenue is bucketed on `orders.created_at` and
 * counts only orders whose CURRENT state is revenue-counting, and a bucket's
 * `refundedCents` answers "what did the orders placed in this period give back",
 * which is the only reading under which the two figures in one row are comparable.
 *
 * **Why the state counts are a map and the revenue is two numbers beside it.**
 * `ordersByStatus` needs every state, including the excluded ones, so a transition is
 * a MOVE: decrement the state the order is leaving, increment the one it enters. The
 * revenue figure cannot be derived from that map, because it sums totals rather than
 * counting orders, so it moves with it — in when a state in the allow-list is entered,
 * out when one is left. `revenueOrders` is not decoration either: it is what
 * distinguishes "no order in this bucket counts as revenue" from "an order whose total
 * really is zero", and the SQL distinguishes them (a zero-total row still produces a
 * bucket), so the document has to.

 *   legacy rewrite), and a first migration with nothing known starts it at 0. Every write
 *   of this version moves it past the highest epoch it knows of, and `reconcile` heals
 *   whatever a rewound epoch let through.
 * - `seq` is bumped by EVERY delta. A recompute commits guarded on the `(epoch, seq)` it
 *   pinned before scanning, so a delta landing after the pin costs it the commit.
 *
 * The host's `updateIf` never moves a document's revision, so neither guard could be the
