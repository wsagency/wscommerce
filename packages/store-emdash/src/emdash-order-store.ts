/**
 * `OrderStore` over EmDash's plugin-storage primitives, on the one-document order
 * aggregate: `orders/{orderId}` carries the header, the frozen line snapshot, the
 * totals, the ship-to, the audit events, the email outbox and the embedded
 * ledgers, so every order-only invariant is one document's compare-and-set.
 *
 * ## Creation is a claim, then a create-if-absent
 *
 * `orders.idempotency_key` UNIQUE was the SQL's once-only guard, and a returning-
 * nothing insert made the whole call a replay. Here the guard is
 * `order_keys/{idempotencyKey}` (ADR-0019 §7.9), and the order of the two writes
 * is load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **Claim** `order_keys/{key}` create-if-absent, carrying the WHOLE prepared
 *    order document — order id, minted line ids, timestamps, everything — so any
 *    replayer finishes the create byte for byte instead of minting a second set of
 *    ids. A refused claim means the key has already minted an order: the call is a
 *    replay and returns `{ created: false, order }`.
 * 2. **Create** `orders/{orderId}` create-if-absent from the claim's payload. One
 *    write carries header + `readonly items` + totals + address together, which is
 *    where the SQL's multi-row `order_items` insert, its 1:1 `order_totals` row and
 *    its conditional `order_shipping_address` row all went.
 * 3. **Promote** the claim to `terminal`, dropping the payload. NEVER before
 *    step 2: a terminal key pointing at a non-existent order reads as "already
 *    minted" and would lose the checkout.
 *
 * The window is "claim written, order document not yet created", and it is
 * HEALED rather than tolerated — `createFromCart` and `getByIdempotencyKey` both
 * complete a `claimed` key they find, which is why the payload is carried at all.
 *
 * **Snapshot immutability is structural, not a discipline.** {@link OrderDoc.items}
 * is `readonly OrderItemDoc[]` with every element field `readonly`, and it is
 * written ONLY by step 2. Every later write in this file is `{ ...doc, … }`, which
 * carries that very array by reference — so there is no code path, and cannot be
 * one without a compile error, that rewrites a price or a title after purchase.
 *
 * ## The transition is ONE write
 *
 * ADR-0019 §7.10: the guarded flip, the appended audit event and the first-wins
 * outbox entry are a SINGLE `compareAndSet` guarded on the document revision AND
 * on `state === fromState` (plus, for expiry, on the deadline). So:
 *
 * - "flipped but no event" is unreachable, as it already was under the SQL's
 *   transaction;
 * - the outbox once-only is per `(orderId, toState)` — an entry is appended iff
 *   none with that target state exists, which is where
 *   `UNIQUE(order_id, to_state)` went. It is NOT per event;
 * - a lost race is a clean no-op: the guard fails, nothing is written, and no
 *   event is recorded (audit never double-counts a replay).
 *
 * ## The three hold brackets — the one real cross-aggregate edge
 *
 * Adopting, committing and releasing an order's reservations writes N inventory
 * documents, and no primitive can bracket them with the order write. So each is
 * ADR-0019 §1's other shape — **intent, per-id idempotent write, completion** —
 * and the intent is recorded IN the order document, in the same write as the state
 * change that implies it:
 *
 * | Bracket | Intent recorded by | Per-id write | Completed by |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | adopt | `createFromCart` (before the use-case's `adoptMany`) | `adoptMany`, idempotent per reservation id | {@link EmdashOrderStore.completeHoldAdoption} |
 * | commit | the `→ paid` flip (before settle's `commitMany`) | singular `commit` per id | {@link EmdashOrderStore.completeHoldCommit} |
 * | release | the `→ expired` AND `→ cancelled` flips | `releaseAdopted` per id, order-scoped | {@link EmdashOrderStore.completeHoldRelease} |
 *
 * The cancellation leg is the one the SQL adapter had no analogue for (its cancel was
 * a pure envelope write): a cancelled order no longer claims its holds, so it records
 * the same intent expiry does. `releaseAdopted`'s ADOPTED-ONLY guard is what makes that
 * safe on a PAID order cancelled after settle — a `committed` hold is not adopted, so
 * the release is an unconditional no-op and spent units are never returned.
 *
 * An intent whose `completedAt` is `null` is the marker that work is owed; each
 * completion is idempotent and callable by ANY replayer, which is what makes a
 * partial batch safe. The commit completion drives the **singular** `commit` per
 * id rather than re-running `commitMany`, because ADR-0019 §2 is explicit that
 * `commitMany` SKIPS an already-`committed` id: a SKU caught between its terminal
 * record and its prune is finished by the singular call, never by the batch.
 *
 * ## The refund ceiling is one write on this document
 *
 * `min(Σ captured, frozen total)` was computed under a row lock on `orders` so two
 * concurrent refunds could not each read the same headroom. Here `payments[]` and
 * `refunds[]` are fields of the very document the refund is appended to, so the
 * ceiling, the ACTIVE-capacity arbitration and the row all live inside ONE
 * compare-and-set — the revision doing what the lock did. The four-state capacity
 * lifecycle (ADR-0019 R6) is read and written in that same step: `reserved` and
 * `unverified` HOLD capacity, `voided` releases it, and `finalizeRefund` is
 * status-guarded and NEVER re-arbitrates, because its reservation already holds what
 * it is about to finalize. `refund_keys/{key}` exists because the settle half of the
 * protocol carries only the key — and, like `order_keys`, it carries the whole
 * prepared row so a crash before the order write is completed rather than re-minted.
 *
 * Fulfillment and cancellation ride the same guarded flip as every other state
 * change (`#flip`'s `envelope`), never a parallel copy of it; cancellation also
 * records the release intent, because a cancelled order no longer claims its holds.
 *
 * ## The email-outbox lease landed here, ahead of its increment
 *
 * The fulfillment and cancellation specs both assert that exactly ONE notification
 * DRAINS, which runs `dispatchOrderEmails` — so `claimNextEmail`, `markEmailSent`
 * and `rescheduleEmail` are a dependency of this increment's own gate, the way
 * `recordPayment` was a dependency of the previous one's. They implement ADR-0019's
 * R2: the SQL's OR-and-negation claim predicate becomes the single denormalized
 * {@link OrderDoc.emailDueAt} index, and the claim re-applies that predicate to the
 * entry it picked inside one compare-and-set.
 *
 * ## The whole port is implemented
 *
 * Every `OrderStore` method has a real implementation: the lists, the search, the
 * counts, the customer view, guest linking and the outbox settle path were the last
 * four, and there is no `NotImplementedInIncrementError` left to throw anywhere in this
 * package. What the ADMIN LIST cannot do is narrower and is a matter of SEMANTICS rather
 * than of a missing method: the port's `search` documents an unanchored `buyer_ref`
 * SUBSTRING, and the host's filter algebra has no substring operator — so that arm is
 * served as a PREFIX (ADR-0019 §6.1's ratified narrowing). See
 * {@link EmdashOrderStore.listOrders} and the package README.

 * {@link compare}), which is the ordering the port's cursor position and
 * {@link isAfterCursor} are defined in. The HOST's `order by` breaks its `createdAt` ties
 * on the storage `id` COLUMN under the database's collation — and Postgres's default
 * collation is not code-unit order: it ignores punctuation at the primary level, so `oa`
 * and `o-b` sort in one order there and the other order here.
 *
 * That only matters where rows are DROPPED, so the rule is: **an arm is drained to the end
 * of its boundary tie group before anything is sliced.** `#scanOrders` and
 * `#ordersMatchingSku` both keep reading past `need` until `createdAt` changes, and only
 * then does `listOrders` sort by this comparator and slice. Truncating at `need` in the
 * host's row order would let a tied row that Postgres ordered differently fall off one page
 * without appearing on the next — a silent gap, on one dialect only.
 *
 * `createdAt` itself is safe to compare either way: it is fixed-width ISO-8601 UTC, so
 * lexical, chronological and collated order coincide.
