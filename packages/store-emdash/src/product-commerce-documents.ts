/**
 * The product-commerce document model: one aggregate document per product, with
 * its variants embedded in it, plus one claim document per live sku.
 *
 * **Why the variants live inside the product document.** Every invariant that
 * spans a product and its sizes is a currency invariant — a repricing must not
 * leave a live size holding another currency, and a first pricing of one size
 * must not disagree with a sibling's. In SQL those were resolved by taking the
 * parent row's lock first, in a written-down lock order, and the order was only
 * *mostly* total (its own docblock says so). Embedded, the two writers contend
 * for ONE document revision, so the interleaving the lock order existed to
 * forbid is unreachable rather than merely ordered — and `updateVariantFields`
 * resolves the product's currency from the same value it is about to write.
 *
 * **A variant may arrive before its product row, so presence is a field.** The
 * CMS delivers `content:afterSave` and the repeater's rows as independent
 * fire-and-forget calls, and the port requires a variant to land regardless. The
 * document is therefore created by whichever write arrives first, and
 * {@link ProductCommerceDoc.lifecycle} says whether a *product row* exists at
 * all: `"absent"` is a document that only holds variants, and `getByProductId`
 * answers `null` for it exactly as it would for a document that does not exist.
 * That is also what keeps such a shell out of every list — the lists filter on
 * `lifecycle`, which is one indexed field carrying the three states the port
 * distinguishes (live, tombstoned, no row) where a nullable `deletedAt` could
 * only carry two (the filter algebra has no negation, so "tombstoned" cannot be
 * expressed as "not null").
 *
 * **Live-sku uniqueness is a claim document, not an index.** `sku_owners/{sku}`
 * names the one live sellable unit that holds a sku — a product row or a variant
 * — and it is written create-if-absent, which is a DB-level
 * `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. The two partial unique indexes it replaces
 * (`UNIQUE (sku) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` and `… WHERE orphaned_at IS NULL`)
 * were unique *among live rows only*, and that "among live rows" becomes
 * {@link SkuOwnerDoc.live}: a soft delete or an orphaning releases the claim, and
 * a new claimant takes over a released document by compare-and-set. No unique
 * index is relied upon anywhere — the harness cannot materialize one and the
 * host's index sync degrades silently (ADR-0019 §5).
 *
 * Dates are stored as ISO-8601 UTC text, never as `Date`: a `Date` does not
 * round-trip through a JSON column, and ISO text compares lexicographically
 * exactly as it compares chronologically, which is what every watermark guard on
 * this port already relies on. Branded types (`Money`, `Sku`, `ProductId`,
 * `IdempotencyKey`) are stored as themselves — the brands are erased at runtime,
 * so the stored JSON is plain, and the same convention the order documents use.

/**
 * The two collections `EmdashProductCommerceStore` owns, with the indexes each
 * must declare. A declared index is a **read contract**, not a performance knob:
 * a `where`/`orderBy` on an undeclared field is a runtime `StorageQueryError`, so
 * this list and the descriptor's must not drift.
 *
 * `productId` is declared — even though it IS the document id — because the two
 * BATCH reads (`getManyByProductId`, `listCommerceByIds`) fetch a whole batch with
 * one `productId in [...]` query instead of a `get` per id. That is the surviving
 * half of the port's anti-N+1 invariant: a document store has no join, so the stock
 * a view needs is still one read per distinct sku, but the product half stays one
 * statement per 100 ids exactly as the SQL was one statement per batch.
 *
 * `lifecycle`, `publishKey`, `productKind` and `taxClass` are the equality axes the
 * admin list and `countByTaxClass` filter on; `createdAt` is what the list
 * ORDERS by, and ordering on an undeclared field throws exactly as filtering on
 * one does.
 *
 * **`active` is filtered through a STRING mirror, `publishKey`.** The host turns a
 * `where` value into a bound parameter, and on the better-sqlite3 path a boolean
 * reaches the driver unconverted and throws `SQLite3 can only bind numbers, strings,
 * bigints, buffers, and null` before any comparison runs — measured against the build
 * this package is written for, where the first contract run failed exactly there.
 * Whether that is a driver law or one missing coercion in the host's query builder is
 * not this package's to settle: the adapter is written against the host it is given.
 * So the publish gate is stored twice — `active` is the boolean the port reads back,
 * `publishKey` is the indexed text the filter binds, and {@link publishKeyFor} is the
 * only thing that derives one from the other, so they cannot drift. If the host later
 * coerces booleans the mirror becomes redundant rather than wrong.
 *
 * **`titleLower` is deliberately NOT declared, against ADR-0019 §4's table.**
 * The port's `search` is a case-insensitive SUBSTRING on the title (it says so,
 * and the contract pins it), and the filter algebra has no `contains` — so no
 * declared index could serve it and declaring one would be a read contract for a
 * query that is never issued. The title half of the search is resolved in memory
 * over the rows the indexed axes already narrowed; see
 * `EmdashProductCommerceStore.listProducts`.
 *
 * `sku_owners` declares its natural key, which IS its document id — a lookup
 * plan, never the enforcement. The store reaches it by id alone.
 *
 * Declared as a plain (non-unique) `indexes` entry, NOT `uniqueIndexes`: the
 * host materializes a declared unique index as ONE PHYSICAL SQLITE INDEX per
 * plugin, keyed on `(plugin_id, collection, <field>)` with no `WHERE`
 * clause — it is not scoped to this collection alone. Any OTHER collection
 * under this plugin that also carries a top-level `sku` field (`inventory`'s
 * `reservation_keys` and `reservation_index` both do, one row per reserve
 * attempt, many rows legitimately sharing one sku) collides on that same
 * physical index the moment a second such row exists — a production
 * incident (2026-09-22), not a hypothetical. The create-if-absent CAS
 * against the sku-as-id is the real enforcement; the index is a lookup plan
 * only and must stay non-unique.
