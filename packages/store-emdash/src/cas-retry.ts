/**
 * The bounded, jittered compare-and-set retry — and the typed error a caller
 * gets when the budget runs out.
 *
 * `compareAndSet` is the only general read-modify-write atomicity primitive a
 * plugin has: read the document with its revision, compute the next value in JS,
 * commit it against that revision. `{ applied: false }` means somebody else
 * committed first, so the whole step is re-run against the new value. A
 * host-level retryable abort (Postgres `40001` serialization failure or `40P01`
 * deadlock, surfaced as a structural `StorageSerializationError`) is the same
 * situation and is retried identically.
 *
 * **This is a permanent contention budget, not an interim one.** There is no
 * nested-path guarded update available, so a hot SKU's aggregate is written by
 * read-modify-write and will retry under load. The answer is a bounded budget, a
 * typed retryable failure, and measurement — never an unbounded loop (which turns
 * contention into a hung request) and never a silent give-up.

/**
 * The attempt ceiling per compare-and-set step.
 *
 * **Why 24, and why it used to be 12.** Every failed attempt means a *different*
 * writer committed to the same document, so what a writer can lose is bounded by
 * how many peers can successfully commit while it is in flight — and that bound is
 * a property of the DOCUMENT, not of the crowd.
 *
 * - The **inventory** bound now includes claimed failures. The original
 *   unit-bounded measurement preceded durable failed-reserve witnesses: a caller
 *   that already claimed its key must arbitrate its failed decision in the SKU
 *   aggregate, or a same-key success can race the terminal failure and lose stock.
 *   These witnesses also write when no units remain, so depth depends on the
 *   claimed crowd. The current flash-sale shapes measured 15/13 in CI and 18/23
 *   locally for M5/N50 and M1/N100 respectively. Larger crowds can exhaust this
 *   ceiling and receive a typed retryable refusal. No units move on a failed CAS.
 * - The **order document** bound is money movements, and it is roughly
 *   `2 × (refunds that fit under the ceiling) + 1` — each gateway refund writes
 *   TWICE (the reservation, then the finalize) and the ceiling-reaching one folds
 *   the `→ refunded` flip into its second write. A 1,000-cent ceiling refunded 100
 *   at a time is 10 refunds, so 21 peer writes, and the refunds increment measured
 *   a depth of 11 against the old 12 — inside it, but only by luck of ordering.
 *
 * - The **rules documents** (a shipping zone, a tax class) are the ONE exception to
 *   "the bound is a property of the document": their three structural edits
 *   (`updateZone`, `updateMethod`, `updateClass`) are last-writer-wins by port
 *   contract, so they have no guard to refuse anybody and every writer of the same
 *   document eventually commits. A writer can therefore lose its revision once per
 *   peer that commits ahead of it, and the bound is the CROWD: measured 12 at N=24
 *   (`test/rules-cas-race.pg.test.ts`), with roughly N > 40 on one document raising
 *   {@link StorageContentionError} — nothing written, safe to retry. No invariant
 *   rides on it; the money edits on those same documents keep refusing cleanly as
 *   `stale`.
 *
 * So 24 is a bounded operating ceiling, not a guarantee that every crowd finishes
 * in one call. **The extra
 * attempts buy jittered backoff on a path that would otherwise throw**
 * {@link StorageContentionError}: a caller that was going to be told "too busy" now
 * waits instead, and nothing about the invariants changes either way — a losing
 * writer never applies its update, and an exhausted budget is still a typed
 * retryable refusal rather than a wrong answer or a hung request. The worst-case
 * wall time is bounded by {@link CAS_MAX_DELAY_MS}, which caps each sleep at 50 ms.
 *
 * A change to this number is a change to the contention budget: measure first (every
 * race suite records the maximum depth observed), then move it. The per-shape
 * assertions all bound the measured depth AT or BELOW this constant.
 * `CAS_ATTEMPT_BUDGET` in `test/inventory-crash-seams.dialects.test.ts` independently
 * pins 24 and checks every busy command's original-key recovery, stable outcome
 * and exact stock conservation; increasing the production ceiling alone fails
 * that configuration guard. The coupon suite keeps its separate tighter budget.
