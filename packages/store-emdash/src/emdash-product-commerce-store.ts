/**
 * `ProductCommerceStore` over the EmDash plugin-storage primitives.
 *
 * The SQL adapter this replaces leaned on four database features that do not
 * exist here, and each one becomes a document:
 *
 * | The SQL | Here |
 * |---|---|
 * | `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (product_id) DO UPDATE … WHERE <two guards>` | one `compareAndSet` on `product_commerce/{productId}` whose guards are computed in JS against the value it just read |
 * | the CAS on `updated_at` plus a zero-row classifier | the same classifier, in the same order, inside that compare-and-set — with the document revision as a second, cheaper staleness check |
 * | two **partial** unique indexes (`WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`, `WHERE orphaned_at IS NULL`) plus reciprocal cross-table checks | ONE `sku_owners/{sku}` claim document (ADR-0019 R4) |
 * | a written-down lock order over `product_commerce → inventory → product_variants` | variants EMBEDDED in the product document, so there is one revision to win and no order to get wrong; plus the intent-claim carry in `sku-stock-transfer.ts` |
 *
 * **The guard order is the specification, and it is unchanged.** For both guarded
 * editors: `not_found` (unknown or tombstoned) → same-key replay returns `ok` →
 * `stale` → the currency mismatches → apply. For the sku axis, on every writer:
 * `SkuConflictError` (another live sellable unit holds the sku) outranks
 * `SkuHeldStockError` (the source still has a live hold), which outranks
 * `SkuStockConflictError` (the target already has an inventory document). The
 * first is decided by the claim document, the other two inside the carry — which
 * is exactly the SQL adapter's order, and the reason it is written down here is
 * that nothing in the document model enforces it by construction.
 *
 * **What the lists can and cannot push into the store.** `query`'s filter is
 * AND-only with no substring, no negation and no OR (ADR-0019 §6). So:
 *
 * - the tombstone axis is an indexed THREE-state `lifecycle` field rather than a
 *   nullable `deletedAt`, because "tombstoned" is a negation of "null" and the
 *   algebra has none — and because a third state is needed anyway for a document
 *   that holds variants but no product row;
 * - `active` and `productKind` are indexed equalities, pushed down;
 * - `search` is a case-insensitive SUBSTRING on the title OR an exact match on the
 *   sku — an OR of which one half no index can serve — so it is resolved IN MEMORY
 *   over the rows the indexed axes narrowed;
 * - `lowStockThreshold` pairs each candidate with its `inventory` document. There
 *   is no join, so this is a read per candidate sku, memoized per call and issued
 *   in parallel per page. The port's "never an N+1 of per-row reads" is a
 *   statement about not making the CALLER pay a round trip per row, and that still
 *   holds; a document store cannot make it one statement.
 *
 * The scan is bounded exactly as the order store's is: reaching the page ceiling
 * with rows still owed is a typed `ScanPageLimitError`, never a silently short
 * list.

	/**
	 * RE-ASSERT the sku claim immediately before the product document commits, and
	 * re-stamp its lease while doing it.
	 *
	 * **The hole this closes.** `#claimSku` proves ownership when the claim is taken,
	 * not when the write lands, and the two are different instants. A writer that
	 * stalls past {@link CLAIM_ABANDON_AFTER_MS} between them has its claim taken over
	 * as abandoned — correctly, from the newcomer's point of view — and then resumes and
	 * commits its product document anyway, because that compare-and-set guards the
	 * PRODUCT document's revision and can see nothing at all about the claim. Two live
	 * rows would then name one sku, and the stalled writer's carry would deposit its
	 * units under a sku the newcomer owns.
	 *
	 * So the claim is compare-and-set at the revision this call last saw, carrying a
	 * fresh `claimedAt`. That single write does both jobs: it PROVES the claim is still
	 * ours (a takeover changed the revision, so the write fails), and it restarts the
	 * lease from the commit attempt, so a writer that is merely slow — a retry storm on
	 * a contended document — keeps its claim instead of being reaped for being busy. It
	 * runs on EVERY attempt of the retry loop, for that reason.
	 *
	 * Returns false when the claim moved but is still ours (a peer of the same owner
	 * heartbeat it first): the step re-runs. Throws `SkuConflictError` — the port's
	 * own live-sku refusal, already mapped to 409 at the boundary — when it is gone,
	 * and the product document is NOT written.
	 *
	 * **The residual, stated exactly.** Two-document atomicity does not exist here, so
	 * this closes the window down to the gap between two ADJACENT statements: the
	 * heartbeat and the product compare-and-set. A pause of the FULL lease length in
	 * that gap would still be overtaken. That is the residual every lease scheme has,
	 * and 60 s is what makes it unreachable in practice: the entire retry budget is
	 * `CAS_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (24) attempts with each sleep capped at `CAS_MAX_DELAY_MS`
	 * (50 ms), under two seconds end to end, so a pause thirty times longer than the
	 * whole budget would have to land between two consecutive awaits.
	 *
	 * **Clock skew.** The lease compares the READER's clock against the CLAIMANT's
	 * `claimedAt`, so two workers whose clocks disagree measure different ages: a
	 * reader running fast may judge a live claim abandoned early, one running slow may
	 * wait longer than a minute. The heartbeat decides who loses, and it is always the
	 * SLOW writer rather than the data: an early takeover moves the claim's revision,
	 * so the original writer's pre-commit compare-and-set fails and it refuses typed
	 * instead of committing a second live row. Skew therefore costs a merchant a
	 * spurious retry, never a sku with two owners.
