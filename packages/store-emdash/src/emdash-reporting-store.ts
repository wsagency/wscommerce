/**
 * `ReportingStore` over precomputed day documents — the one adapter in this package
 * whose port moved from READ time to WRITE time.
 *
 * The SQL answered `revenueByPeriod` and `ordersByStatus` with one `GROUP BY` over
 * `orders` joined to `order_totals` and `refunds`, with the period bucket as a
 * dialect-branched truncation. A plugin has no join, no aggregate and no raw SQL, so
 * those two reports are served from `reporting_daily` — one document per (currency, UTC
 * day) holding the counters a window folds — and the two reports that CANNOT be
 * precomputed are still computed on read:
 *
 * ```
 * revenueByPeriod  reporting_daily, paged by the `date` range, folded to day/week/month
 * ordersByStatus   reporting_daily, the same scan, folded over `stateCounts`
 * topProducts      a scan of `orders`, over the FROZEN line snapshots
 * lowStock         a scan of `inventory`, titled through the live sku claim
 * ```
 *
 * **Why those two stayed on read.** A per-product-per-day rollup would make the day
 * document grow without bound in the catalogue, and `lowStock` has no window at all —
 * it is a current-state question about stock, which is one scan of a collection that is
 * the size of the sku list. Neither is a counter, so neither gains anything from being
 * written ahead of time.
 *
 * **What a rollup costs, stated honestly.** Reporting becomes work on the write path:
 * every transition and every finalized refund owes a claim and a counter write, and the
 * order store's hook is what pays it (after the order write is durable, and never able
 * to fail it). The counters are DERIVED, so they can drift — a lost event, a crash
 * between the claim and the write — and {@link EmdashReportingStore.reconcile} is the
 * definition they are restored to. That division is deliberate: the delta stream is
 * responsible for never drifting in the dangerous direction, the recompute for
 * eventually being exact (ADR-0019's cross-cutting rule (c)).
 *
 * **The window is EXACT, whatever instants it names.** The day document is the counters
 * for a whole day, so it can only answer for a day the window covers whole: the interior
 * of a window is read from the documents, and an EDGE day the window truncates is
 * computed from an instant-filtered scan of that day's orders instead (at most two such
 * days, and only when a bound is not midnight). `created_at BETWEEN from AND to`
 * therefore means the same thing here as it did in the statement this replaced, and a
 * ragged window costs two bounded scans rather than an approximation.

	/**
	 * Fold one order event into the day document the order was CREATED in.
	 *
	 * Two documents, in this order and for this reason:
	 *
	 * ```
	 * epoch    reporting_daily/{currency}:{day} read (created or migrated if need be)
	 * claim    reporting_applied/{claim} create-if-absent — the once-only gate
	 * counters reporting_daily/{currency}:{day} ONE guarded numeric delta — the value
	 * stamp    the claim's `appliedAt`, best-effort, as a diagnostic
	 * ```
	 *
	 * **The counters are one statement, not a read-modify-write loop.** Every order
	 * created on a day in a currency shares one document, so a compare-and-set here made
	 * every checkout that day contend with every other one, and nothing ever refused a
	 * writer: retry depth grew with the crowd until the typed contention error, and each
	 * checkout paid the backoff inline. The delta is `updateIf` with the arithmetic done
	 * in SQL, which the database serializes on the row lock instead of refusing, so a
	 * busy day costs each event one write however many peers it has.
	 *
	 * **Why the epoch is read BEFORE the claim is made.** The delta is guarded on that
	 * epoch, and a recompute bumps it when it commits. So if a recompute counts this event
	 * absolutely (which it can only do after the claim exists, and it absorbs the claim to
	 * say so) and commits before the delta lands, the delta is refused in the same statement
	 * that would have double-counted, and re-checks its claim. See {@link #applyEvent}.
	 *
	 * **The claim is first, so the residue is an under-count.** A crash between the two
	 * leaves an event spent and its counters unmoved: the report says less revenue than
	 * came in and leaves the order in the state bucket it has already left, and
	 * {@link reconcile} repairs it. The other order — counters first — would leave an
	 * event unclaimed whose delta had already landed, and its redelivery would count the
	 * same money twice. Between an under-count that heals and an over-count that
	 * compounds, this tier resolves toward the first every time.
	 *
	 * **A transition MOVES an order between buckets.** The state it leaves is
	 * decremented and the state it enters incremented, and revenue follows the same
	 * rule through the allow-list — which is why the event carries the order's net
	 * total: leaving `paid` for `refunded` has to take that number back out. A refund is
	 * not a transition and is not driven by one: it adds to the day's refunded total
	 * whatever the order's state is, which is what makes a fully refunded order's money
	 * reportable at all.
	 *
	 * Calling it twice is calling it once. A second delivery finds the claim and returns
	 * without a write.

	/**
	 * Recompute every day document in the range from the ORDERS, and absorb the claims
	 * for the events it folded in.
	 *
	 * This is the routine a periodic heal runs, and it is the definition the delta stream
	 * is a cache of: a day's counters are whatever a scan of the orders created that day
	 * says they are.
	 *
	 * **It is safe to run while events are landing, and three things make it so.** They
	 * are stated in the order the code does them, because the order is the argument:
	 *
	 * 1. **Pin before scanning.** Every day document this attempt may write has its guards
	 *    (`epoch`, `seq`; the revision for a legacy or absent one) read BEFORE the orders
	 *    are scanned, and the commit is guarded on them. Any delta that lands after that
	 *    bumps `seq`, so the commit is refused and the whole day is re-scanned. Reading the
	 *    orders first and pinning afterwards would do the opposite: a transition landing in
	 *    between would be committed away, because the value in hand predates it and the
	 *    pin would not say so. (The pin cannot be the revision here: the host's `updateIf`
	 *    never moves it, so it would not see a delta at all.)
	 * 2. **Absorb the claims the scan folded in, before committing.** A claim is the
	 *    right to move these counters; once a recompute has counted the event
	 *    absolutely, that right is spent, and `absorbedAt` is how the claim says so. The
	 *    claims absorbed are exactly the ones RECONSTRUCTED from the scanned orders —
	 *    never every claim an order has — because a claim whose transition is not in the
	 *    scanned document describes something the recompute did not count, and absorbing
	 *    that one would drop its delta.
	 * 3. **The commit bumps `epoch`, and every delta is guarded on the epoch it read
	 *    before its claim was checked** (`#applyEvent`). So an event whose order this
	 *    recompute already counted, and whose own delta had not landed yet, is refused by
	 *    the delta's own statement, re-reads its claim, and becomes a SKIP rather than a
	 *    second increment. That is why a commit bumps the epoch even over an exact document
	 *    when the attempt absorbed claims.
	 *
	 * What is left is one residue, and it is in the safe direction: a transition that
	 * lands after the scan read its order but before the absorb reaches its claim is
	 * absorbed without having been counted, and its delta is then skipped — an
	 * UNDER-count, healed by the next run. A process that dies between the absorb and the
	 * commit leaves the same shape. Neither can double-count, because nothing here ever
	 * applies a delta whose claim is absorbed.
	 *
	 * A failed attempt can leave claims absorbed that this attempt never committed
	 * counters for; the next successful run absorbs nothing new and commits the absolute
	 * value, which lifts them. That is the same under-counting residue in another dress,
	 * and it is why a CLOSED day is the cheap and safe thing to reconcile: yesterday and
	 * older have no live events to race, so an attempt cannot lose its pin. **Reconcile a
	 * closed day as a matter of course, and a live day only on demand** — a live day's
	 * events are still arriving, so a recompute over it is a race it may have to re-run.
	 *
	 * The page budget is per DAY, so a long range is safe by construction; a caller
	 * sweeping a large history should still chunk it (a month at a time keeps one call's
	 * work, and one call's retries, bounded).

	 * every one of them widens the window in which a live delta invalidates the pin — a

	 * recompute is there to lift. A query PER ORDER is the same mistake one step up: it
	 * makes the cost a function of how many orders the day holds, so a large day exhausts
	 * its budget and can never heal.
	 *
	 * So a day's claims are read by the axis they are filed under — `date`, which is the
	 * order's creation day and therefore the day being recomputed — and the pass costs **one
	 * unit per claim-index page and one unit per claim absorbed**, the same unit a page of
	 * orders costs. A claim an earlier run already absorbed costs neither: it is skipped
	 * before any spend and before any write, which is what makes a steady-state recompute
	 * cheap and a first heal the only expensive one.
	 *
	 * A budget refusal from this pass is a `ScanPageLimitError` naming operation
	 * `absorbReportingClaims` and option `maxReconcilePages` — the pair an operator sees, and

 *
 * **Every decrement is FLOORED at zero**, which is the one place this adapter tolerates
 * being wrong: a decrement whose matching increment was lost would otherwise drive a
 * counter negative and report a negative revenue. Per counter the result is exactly the
 * read-modify-write's, `max(held - dec, 0) + inc`, expressed so it stays correct under
 * peers' deltas:
 *
 * - `held >= dec` (the healthy case): the delta is `inc - dec`, guarded on `>= dec`, so
 *   peers' deltas landing first can only keep the guard true or, if they drain the
 *   counter, refuse the write so it is planned again.
 * - `held < dec` (drift): the delta is `inc - held`, guarded on the counter still being
 *   exactly `held` (or absent), so the floor is taken against the value it was judged on.
 *   It is announced, because flooring is proof that something was lost. That exact-value
 *   guard DOES couple the writer to its peers: any peer delta moving that counter first
 *   refuses it, and it re-plans once per such write. That is accepted because it only
 *   runs on drift, which is rare and already a case for a recompute.
 *
 * Increments are checked against the safe-integer ceiling here, from the value read,
 * so an overflow is the `RangeError` it always was rather than a guard refusal the
 * retry loop could not tell from contention.
