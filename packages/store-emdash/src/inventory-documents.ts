/**
 * The inventory document model: one aggregate document per SKU, with the live
 * holds embedded in it, plus three per-key claim collections.
 *
 * **Why the holds live inside the inventory document.** An inventory decrement
 * is not idempotent unless the row records who applied it. A two-step "claim a
 * reservation, then decrement" cannot tell crash-before-decrement from
 * crash-after unless the inventory row names the reservation that moved the
 * units — so the holds map lives in the inventory document, and the guard
 * (`onHand >= qty`, computed in JS), the decrement and the hold record all commit
 * in ONE `compareAndSet`. No oversell and once-only are the same atom.
 *
 * **Reserve is still a two-step, and has exactly ONE crash window.** The durable
 * once-only guard is {@link ReservationKeyDoc} — `reservation_keys/{key}`,
 * claimed create-if-absent *before* the inventory write and carrying everything
 * needed to finish the job. The window is "claim written, inventory
 * `compareAndSet` not yet run"; any replayer completes it deterministically,
 * using the reservation id RECORDED in the claim rather than minting a new one,
 * and a sweeper reaps whatever is never replayed. What the embedded aggregate
 * removes is the *SQL* adapter's second window (a `pending` reservation flipped
 * to `held` separately from the decrement), not the claim window — which no
 * single-document primitive can remove, because the claim and the units live in
 * different documents by necessity.
 *
 * **Why `reservation_index` exists.** Six port methods take reservation ids with
 * no sku, and a hold embedded per SKU cannot be found from an id alone. The index
 * document is written before the hold, so an id absent from it is *provably*
 * unknown — which is what lets `commitMany` throw `ReservationNotFoundError` for
 * a truly unknown id while `adoptMany` folds one into `lost`.
 *
 * **Ledgers are bounded.** `adjust` / `restock` / `removeStock` keep their
 * per-key intent in `inventory_movements/{prefixedKey}` — one document per key,
 * updated to `applied` once the units moved — and the aggregate keeps only a
 * bounded ring of the last {@link APPLIED_MOVEMENT_RING_SIZE} applied keys. Each
 * result is promoted onto its durable claim BEFORE its ring witness is evicted;
 * a failed promotion prevents eviction. No periodic healer or timing assumption
 * is needed, and no map on the hot document grows without limit.
 *
 * Document ids are the once-only guard everywhere a claim is needed
 * (`_plugin_storage`'s primary key plus `compareAndSet(id, null, …)`'s
 * `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`). No unique index is relied upon: the test
 * harness cannot materialize one, and the host's index sync degrades silently.
