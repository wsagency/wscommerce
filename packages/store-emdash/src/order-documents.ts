/**
 * The order document model: **one aggregate document per order**, carrying the
 * header, the frozen line snapshot, the totals, the ship-to, the audit events,
 * the email outbox, the payments and refunds ledgers and the cross-aggregate
 * hold intents — plus one claim collection the idempotency key forces.
 *
 * **Why one document.** Every order invariant spans facts that must agree: the
 * state against the audit event that records the flip, the flip against the
 * outbox row the buyer's email drains from, a refund against the ceiling the
 * payments imply, the totals row against the order it belongs to. There is no
 * transaction here, so each of those becomes a single `compareAndSet` on
 * `orders/{orderId}` — ADR-0019 §1's rule applied to the order aggregate.
 *
 * Six SQL features disappear into the shape rather than being reproduced
 * (ADR-0019 §7.9, §7.10, §7.13):
 *
 * - **`orders.idempotency_key` UNIQUE** becomes {@link OrderKeyDoc} —
 *   `order_keys/{idempotencyKey}`, claimed create-if-absent BEFORE the order
 *   document and carrying the whole prepared document, so any replayer can finish
 *   the create deterministically (and mints no second set of line ids).
 * - **`order_items` as a child table** becomes {@link OrderDoc.items}, typed
 *   `readonly` and written ONLY by the creating write. Snapshot immutability stops
 *   being a discipline ("no code path updates a snapshot") and becomes
 *   structural: every later write is `{ ...doc, … }`, which carries the same
 *   array by reference and cannot rewrite an element.
 * - **`order_totals.order_id` as PRIMARY KEY** becomes {@link OrderDoc.totals}
 *   being a field. One totals row per order is tautological.
 * - **`order_events` with no conflict clause** becomes the append-only
 *   {@link OrderDoc.events}, appended in the SAME compare-and-set as the flip it
 *   records — so "flipped but no event" is unreachable, as it already was.
 * - **`order_emails_outbox (order_id, to_state)` UNIQUE** becomes the first-wins
 *   {@link OrderDoc.emailOutbox}: an entry is appended iff no entry with that
 *   `toState` exists yet. The once-only is per `(orderId, toState)`, NOT per
 *   event — a second flip into the same state (never legal today) would append no
 *   second entry.
 * - **`orders.hold_expires_at <= now` as a scan target** becomes the declared,
 *   denormalized {@link OrderDoc.holdExpiresAt} index, which is the only way
 *   `listExpirable` can find work.
 *
 * **The cross-aggregate edges are intents, not atoms.** Adopting and committing a
 * checkout's holds writes N per-SKU inventory documents, which no primitive can
 * bracket with the order write. So the order document records the INTENT before
 * any per-SKU write ({@link HoldIntentDoc}), each per-SKU write is idempotent by
 * reservation id, and a replayer (or the sweeper) completes a partial set from the
 * recorded intent. See `EmdashOrderStore`'s class docblock for the three
 * brackets.
 *
 * **Order notes do NOT live in this document.** ADR-0019 §4 listed per-order notes
 * among the four ledgers that "collapse inside their aggregate", and that one does
 * not hold: a note is operator-supplied free text with no natural bound, appended
 * for as long as an order is discussed, so embedding it would make the size of the
 * hot money-path document a function of how much support wrote about it. INC-B8's
 * `EmdashOrderNotesStore` therefore gets a CHILD collection,
 * `order_notes/{orderId}:{noteId}` indexed on `orderId` — its port only ever reads
 * notes by order and appends one at a time, so nothing it does needs them in the
 * aggregate. One of the two corrections to ADR-0019 §4 recorded in this file (the
 * other is {@link PAYMENT_REFS_COLLECTION}).
 *
 * **Every declared field is now written.** `searchKey` and `emailDueAt` were the last
 * two declared-but-unwritten fields, and INC-B4 (lists, search, the customer view, the
 * outbox lease) is what writes them.
 *
 * Declaring them early was worth doing and did NOT buy what an earlier draft of this
 * docblock claimed. It bought one thing: the descriptor's index list and this file's
 * stopped needing an edit per increment. It did not make the shape final — the same
 * increment had to ADD a field (`buyerRefLower`, once a contract case pinned the edge
 * ADR-0019 R3 left conditional) and two derived collections
 * ({@link ORDER_SKU_INDEX_COLLECTION} for the search's line-sku arm,
 * {@link OUTBOX_KEYS_COLLECTION} for the outbox locator). Neither collection holds truth
 * the order document does not, and nothing is deployed, so "reshaping a collection that
 * holds live orders" was never the constraint it was described as; the real constraint is
 * that a declared index is a READ CONTRACT and an undeclared field throws.
