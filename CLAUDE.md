# CLAUDE.md — WSCommerce

Operational guide for Claude working in this repo. The **why** lives in
[`DEVELOPMENT.md`](./DEVELOPMENT.md) (development practices) and [`README.md`](./README.md)
(architecture); read those first. This file is the quick, agent-facing contract: commands,
conventions, and the guardrails that must not be crossed.

> **Status: locally validated, pre-1.0 foundation.** Upstream phases 0–7 and the WSCommerce integration are present; production/provider acceptance is separate (see `docs/validation.md`). The toolchain below is wired —
> `@otta-sh/domain`, the EmDash plugin (which now runs commerce in-process on `ctx.storage`),
> `@otta-sh/store-emdash`, the payment adapters and the React admin all exist under
> `packages/`. Treat the commands below as live, not aspirational; if one genuinely doesn't
> exist, say so rather than inventing output.

## Non-negotiables

These are build-breaking, not code-review nits (see `DEVELOPMENT.md` for the full rules):

- **TDD, contract-first.** Failing test → code → green → refactor. For anything in
  `@otta-sh/domain`, the behavioral test is written against the **port interface** before any
  adapter. The headline contract is **no oversell under concurrency**.
- **Money is integer minor units, never floats.** A `number` reaching a money field is a type
  error. Branded types (e.g. `Cents`) carry an explicit currency.
- **Ports-and-adapters purity.** `@otta-sh/domain` imports nothing with IO — no `pg`, `ctx`, or
  `fetch`. The boundary is enforced by a dependency check wired into `lint`.
- **Real databases, never mocks.** SQLite (better-sqlite3) is the fast local default; Postgres
  runs in CI. The **concurrency / no-oversell test is Postgres-required** (SQLite can't race).
- **Idempotency in the domain.** Every command carries an `idempotencyKey`; the store enforces
  once-only. Test the replay case.
- **Orders snapshot price + title at purchase time.** Editing a product never rewrites an
  existing order's line items.
- **The plugin is sandbox-clean.** Dev/test against the workerd-on-Node sandbox; Block Kit
  widgets, not React — the discriminator is `format` (`format: "native"` may declare
  `adminEntry`; a `format: "standard"` descriptor that declares `adminEntry` throws at build
  time), and `@otta-sh/plugin` registers `format: "standard"` and stays Block Kit; the plugin's
  **only** egress is `ctx.http` + `allowedHosts`, and commerce truth lives in `ctx.storage`.

## Toolchain & the edit loop

pnpm workspace · tsdown builds · **vitest** tests · **oxfmt** (tabs) · **oxlint** (type-aware) ·
strict TypeScript (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`; internal imports use
`.js`, type-only imports use `import type`).

```bash
pnpm lint         # quick — run after every edit (includes the domain-purity dep check)
pnpm typecheck    # after each round of edits
pnpm test         # vitest; run frequently while implementing
pnpm format       # oxfmt, tabs — run regularly
```

Two tiers sit outside that loop because they need a backing service, and both are CI jobs:

```bash
PG_CONNECTION_STRING=<local pg> pnpm test:pg   # T2 — the race tier; the no-oversell proof
pnpm test:d1                                   # T3 — real D1 in workerd (miniflare); slow, minutes
```

`pnpm test:d1` runs `packages/store-emdash/vitest.d1.config.ts`, a **separate vitest project** under
the Cloudflare workers pool — it is not part of the root `vitest run`. It needs no Cloudflare
account, token or remote database; the D1 is the local miniflare simulator. In CI it is the `d1`
job: nightly, on demand, and as the **release gate** on any PR into `main` and the `main` push that
follows. Per-increment PRs into an integration branch do not run it.

Before a PR: **tests pass, lint clean, formatted, changeset added** if a published package
changed. Migrations are forward-only.

## Branch & commit conventions

- **Branch:** `<type>/<slug>` — type ∈ `feat` `fix` `chore` `docs` `refactor` `test`.
- **PR / commit title tag** — pick the tag for the changed area (don't use interchangeably):

  | Area changed | Tag |
  |---|---|
  | `@otta-sh/domain` (ports, use-cases, invariants) | `[Domain]` |
  | Store/client/payment **adapters** (store-emdash, stripe, x402) | `[Adapters]` |
  | The EmDash **plugin** (storefront, Block Kit panel, sync hooks) and its admin packages (`admin-react`, `admin-presentation`) | `[Plugin]` |
  | `sites/*` (the reference storefront site/theme) | `[Site]` |
  | Shared test/contract packages | `[Test]` |
  | CI / tooling / build | `[CI]` |
  | `adr/`, `*.md`, docs | `[Docs]` |

- **Scope discipline:** one PR = one thing. No drive-by refactors. A systemic change or a
  decision gets its own change and, if it's a decision, an **ADR under `adr/`** (see
  `adr/README.md`).

## Verification before merge

Every task is verified end-to-end before the PR is handed over (default, not opt-in):

- **Domain / adapter tasks** — the **contract suite is the spec**. A change is done
  when its behavioral suite is green against every relevant adapter. Run the no-oversell
  concurrency test **against Postgres** (`better-sqlite3` verifies the SQL, not the race).
  Record the passing run in the PR.
- **Commerce-client tasks** — the client-side contract suite (`packages/plugin/test/contracts/`)
  runs against `InProcessCommerceClient` over a real document store; a case that fails is a
  defect in the client, never a case to soften.
- **Plugin / storefront-UI tasks** — exercise against the **workerd-on-Node sandbox** (not
  trusted in-process mode), drive the storefront with Playwright (`pnpm test:e2e`), and
  attach a screenshot to the PR.
- **Releases (a merge into `main`)** — the full battery, green on the build being released:
  `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm -r build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:pg`, **`pnpm test:d1`**,
  `pnpm test:e2e`. T3 (`test:d1`) is the release gate and runs automatically on the PR into `main`;
  `test:e2e` needs a running target and is still a local step.

## Worktrees & multi-agent work

For parallel or agent-driven work, use one git worktree per task, branched from fresh
`origin/main`:

- **Worktree convention:** siblings named `../otta-wt-<slug>`.
- **Branch types & PR tags:** as above.
- **Verification policy:** as above — the contract suite is the gate; never mark a task done
  while tests fail; never **force-push** `main`; **merge commits only** (squash and rebase
  disabled repo-level); merge only on a fully green, verified PR with the run output recorded
  in the PR body.
