/**
 * The Otta plugin's TRUSTED (in-process) registration descriptor —
 * ADR-0006. A hand-written standard-format `PluginDescriptor`: em-dash's
 * integration generates `import def from "@otta-sh/plugin/plugin";
 * adaptSandboxEntry(def, {...this descriptor})` at build time, so the
 * plugin's `{hooks, routes}` default export runs in the host worker — but
 * `capabilities` and `allowedHosts` are STILL enforced by the
 * PluginContextFactory (`createHttpAccess` gates every `ctx.http.fetch` by
 * hostname), which is what keeps DEVELOPMENT.md §5's "only via ctx.http +
 * allowedHosts" true in trusted mode.
 *
 * Pure module (no IO) so the site-config test can pin every field.

 * The commerce storage layout, as the descriptor field wants it.
 *
 * THE CAST IS A TYPE WIDENING, NOT A LIE, and it is worth the paragraph. em-dash
 * types `StorageCollectionDeclaration.indexes` as `string[]`
 * (`astro/integration/runtime.ts`), but every layer BENEATH that field takes
 * `Array<string | string[]>` and treats a nested array as a COMPOSITE index: the
 * manifest wire shape in `@emdash-cms/plugin-types` declares it that way, and
 * `normalizeIndexes` (`plugins/storage-indexes.ts`) is written as
 * `indexes.map((i) => Array.isArray(i) ? i : [i])`. The descriptor field is simply
 * the narrowest type on the path, and Otta's `orders` and `order_sku_index`
 * collections declare composites the adapters genuinely read by.
 *
 * So the alternative to widening is not "safer types" — it is either dropping the
 * composite entries (the list queries then fail at RUNTIME, against a full
 * sequential scan, with no build-time signal) or flattening them into single-field
 * indexes, which is a different index that does not serve the same query. The cast
 * keeps the value that works and is pinned from the other side by
 * site-config.test.ts, which asserts the composites survive as arrays.
 *
 * COLLECTIONS WITH NO INDEXES stay `{}` and are NOT padded with `indexes: []`
 * here: `adaptSandboxEntry` normalizes exactly that (`indexes: config.indexes ??
 * []`) before the config reaches the host, and padding here would make this module
 * restate a shape it does not own — the thing `commerce-storage.ts` exists to stop.

		// `page:"/tax"`, Shipping on `page:"/shipping"`, Coupons on
		// `page:"/coupons"` — landed in prior slices but never added HERE (the

		// nav because this descriptor never listed them).
