/**
 * The `otta_checkout` stash — the site→`/checkout/pay` handoff.
 *
 * `POST /checkout/place` receives the order id, the Stripe client secret and
 * the order's total; `/checkout/pay` needs the first two to mount the Payment
 * Element and the third to say what it is charging. They travel in a
 * short-lived first-party cookie rather than a query string or a re-POST:
 *
 *  - a URL parameter would put the client secret in browser history, in
 *    bookmarks and in every support ticket a buyer pastes a URL into;
 *  - rendering the pay step from the POST response breaks POST-redirect-GET
 *    (reload becomes a re-POST);
 *  - re-deriving the secret on a GET would mean a GET that can create an order.
 *
 * ── What this cookie does NOT achieve (ADR-0012 decision 6) ───────────────
 * It keeps the secret out of OUR urls on the leg we control. It does not keep
 * it out of urls generally: Stripe's Payment Element redirect appends
 * `payment_intent_client_secret` to our `return_url`, so one hop later it is in
 * history, in the `Referer` of any subresource on the confirmation page, and in
 * Cloudflare's access logs. That is Stripe's wire format. Our mitigations are
 * the confirmation page's `same-origin` referrer policy (external destinations
 * receive no Referer), discarding known provider fields from polling/language
 * targets, never echoing those parameters, and this cookie's deletion on arrival.
 *
 * ── Why `path=/` ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * So `/orders/[orderId]` can DELETE it. A `path=/checkout` cookie is never sent
 * to the confirmation page and therefore cannot be cleared there, which would
 * leave a spent client secret sitting in the browser for the rest of the hold.
 * The deletion is a hard requirement, not a nicety — without it `path=/` has no
 * justification at all.

/**
 * The order total, captured at PLACE-TIME — the figure the PaymentIntent was
 * minted for, so the pay step can say what it is charging (§7: "Pay $40.00",
 * not "Pay now").
 *
 * Two decisions worth stating, because this is the payment path:
 *
 *  - It is a SNAPSHOT, not a pointer to the still-live cart. /checkout/pay may
 *    read the SAME private order's immutable totals to change their locale, but
 *    never requotes the cart or creates an intent. This stash remains the
 *    fallback if that read is unavailable, because it was true at place-time.
 *  - It carries a PRE-FORMATTED string and no minor-unit number. `formatMoney`
 *    is the plugin's one sanctioned money→display boundary and takes branded
 *    `Cents`/`Currency`; the site passes its selected presentation locale, and §7's rule
 *    is that this theme never assembles a money string. Storing the amount would
 *    mean re-branding a JSON-parsed `number` on the pay page — a float or a NaN
 *    away from a wrong figure on a payment button — to re-derive a string the
 *    plugin already produced. So the site holds no money NUMBER at all, which is
 *    a stronger property than "no floats". `currency` rides along because it is
 *    a plain code the layout prints (§7's footer chip), not money.

 * pay the order; it simply loses the amount off the button.
 *
 * Exported because BOTH ends use it: `place.ts` runs the plugin route's reply
 * through it before writing (the dispatcher hands back parsed JSON that its
 * result type only ASSERTS the shape of), and the read below runs the cookie
 * through it. It is ONE function so the two ends apply the same rule — a shape
 * the writer would reject can never be a shape the reader accepts — and so that
 * neither end can turn a missing label into a failed payment. It is not a claim
 * that both ends see the same INPUT: the writer reads a fresh route reply, the
 * reader reads a cookie that may be a deploy old.
 *
 * `currency` is checked against ISO-4217's alpha shape rather than merely being
 * non-empty, because the layout prints it as a currency chip. This cannot reject
 * anything the plugin emits — `currency()` enforces exactly this pattern before
 * `formatMoney` ever runs — so it only ever fires on a cookie that was not
 * written by the current writer. And it DROPS, like every other malformed shape
