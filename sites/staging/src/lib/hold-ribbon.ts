/**
 * The hold ribbon's client-side tick (docs/theme/TEMPERED.md §6).
 *
 * `hold.ts` is the SERVER's answer — the first render, and what a browser with
 * no JavaScript is left holding. This module is the same arithmetic run once a
 * second in the browser, and it lives outside `HoldRibbon.astro` for one
 * reason: three of its behaviours are load-bearing, none of them is visible in
 * a screenshot, and none of them can be pinned by reading the script's source
 * text for a substring.
 *
 *  1. EVERY FRAME IS RECOMPUTED FROM THE ABSOLUTE EXPIRY. Nothing here
 *     decrements a counter. A background tab is throttled to once a minute, a
 *     bfcache restore can hand back a page that has been asleep for an hour,
 *     and a laptop lid closes — a countdown that subtracts a second per tick
 *     comes back wrong from all three, and it comes back wrong in the
 *     shopper-hostile direction, showing time on a hold that has already gone.
 *  2. THE POLITE REGION IS WRITTEN ON A STATE CHANGE, NEVER ON A TICK. Three
 *     announcements in fifteen minutes; nine hundred is an unusable page.
 *  3. THE INTERVAL DROPS ITSELF once no ribbon has anything left to count.
 *
 * The component's `<script>` is a bundled module, not `is:inline`, so it
 * imports this rather than restating it. That is what makes the client and the
 * server ONE definition of the boundary, the labels and the clock format
 * instead of two copies pinned to each other by a grep.
 *
 * The DOM stays on the other side of `HoldRibbonPort`: the script does the
 * querying and the writing, this module decides what should be written. Which
 * is what lets the three behaviours above be driven by a fake clock.
