/**
 * Has this cart FINISHED — produced an order, and stopped being a thing the
 * shopper can change?
 *
 * ── why this is NOT the domain's fence, deliberately ────────────────────────
 * `createOrderFromCart` (`packages/domain/src/orders/create-order-from-cart.ts`)
 * and `guardActiveCart` (`packages/domain/src/cart/use-cases.ts`) both ask
 * `state !== "active"` and reject. They are right to, and this is right not to
 * copy them, because they are answering a different question. They are the
 * AUTHORITY deciding whether to permit a mutation, and an authority must fail
 * closed: a state it does not recognise must never be read as permission.
 *
 * This is a RENDERER deciding which of two screens to draw, and the blast
 * radius of failing closed points the other way. `state !== "active"` here
 * would brick a LIVE cart read-only — no quantity field, no remove button, no
 * way to check out — for a shopper whose cart is perfectly fine. And it would
 * do it on a value that NOTHING narrows at runtime anywhere on the wire path:
 * `CartWire.state` is typed `string`, deliberately wider than the domain's
 * `CartState` union that `InProcessCommerceClient`'s `serializeCart` copies it
 * from — so this site, one real HTTP hop downstream of the plugin, still sees
 * a bare `string` with nothing to narrow it back.
 *
 * `CartWire.orderId` rides that same wide-open path, and it is the reason the
 * plugin normalizes ONE field and not this one: `state` fails safely staying
 * a bare string (`isCartTerminal(undefined)` is `false`, so the page draws the
 * live cart it draws for every unknown state), whereas `orderId` fails
 * UNSAFELY — `undefined !== null` is true, so `cart/index.astro` would offer
 * `/orders/undefined` as the panel's only action. Hence `CartWire.orderId` is
 * declared REQUIRED rather than optional (see its own doc comment on
 * `commerce-client.ts`), and none downstream.
 *
 * So this answers for the ONE state that is genuinely terminal (`checked_out`
 * is one-way — `CartState` in `packages/domain/src/ports/cart-store.ts`, and
 * nothing flips it back), and anything else renders as the live cart it almost
 * certainly is. `isKnownCartState` below is what stops that tolerance being
 * silent.
 *
 * ── what `checked_out` does NOT mean ────────────────────────────────────────
 * PAID. `createOrderFromCart` flips the cart with `cartStore.checkout()` BEFORE
 * `gateway.createIntent()` ever runs, so a buyer sitting on a pending, failed
 * or expired order has an identically `checked_out` cart. Anything rendered
 * behind this predicate may say the CART is finished; it may never say the
 * buyer is.
