/**
 * The hold ribbon's arithmetic (docs/theme/TEMPERED.md §6).
 *
 * A cart line's `expiresAt` (already on the cart wire) → the state, the fill,
 * the label and the clock the ribbon renders. Pure, so the boundaries that
 * matter — the flip to bronze AT sixty seconds, the refusal to draw a negative
 * countdown, the refusal to claim a hold that never existed — are unit-tested
 * rather than eyeballed.
 *
 * The client script in `HoldRibbon.astro` re-derives exactly these three
 * states from the same `expiresAt`; this module is the server's first render
 * and the no-JS answer.

/** The commerce layer's DEFAULT hold TTL, in seconds — 15 minutes.
 *
 *  AUTHORITY: the admin's `holdTtlMinutes` setting, whose unsaved default
 *  (`DEFAULT_OPERATIONAL_SETTINGS` in @otta-sh/domain) is 15 minutes. Since
 *  issue #127 the setting IS the cart hold — the plugin's cart use-cases stamp
 *  every deadline with it — so a store whose operator changed it runs a
 *  different window from this one. The PDP's hold note reads the effective value
 *  off the route (see {@link holdNote}); this constant is the ribbon's only.
 *
 *  It is ONLY the fill's denominator. The ribbon needs a window to draw a
 *  fraction against because the wire carries the expiry INSTANT, not the length
 *  of the hold; the countdown, the state and the clock all come from
 *  `expiresAt` and are unaffected by this number. Getting it wrong therefore
 *  cannot mis-state the time left — it draws a bar at the wrong width (600 here
 *  clamped a 15-minute hold's bar at full for its first 300 seconds, then
 *  drained it half again too fast).
 *  A store on a longer TTL is clamped, never overflowed; `holdView` takes an
 *  explicit `windowSeconds` for that case. */
