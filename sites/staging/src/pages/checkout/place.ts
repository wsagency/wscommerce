/**
 * POST /checkout/place — the order-creation shim (ADR-0003): validate the
 * form, dispatch the plugin's public `storefront/checkout/place`, stash the
 * client secret and the order's total in a first-party cookie, 303 to the
 * payment step.
 *
 * This is the step boundary the design turns on. The Payment Element cannot
 * mount without a client secret, and the client secret does not exist until the
 * order is created — so order creation is necessarily its own POST. Splitting
 * it here also means the order (which reserves stock for 15 minutes) is created
 * only after the buyer has committed contact details, not on page view.
 *
 * The `idempotencyKey` arrives FROM THE FORM — `checkout:<cartId>`, derived by
 * the plugin's summary route — and is forwarded verbatim; this endpoint never
 * invents one. Unlike the cart forms' fresh-per-render keys it is STABLE per
 * cart, so a double-click, a reload or a back-then-forward replays into the
 * same order and the same PaymentIntent instead of minting a second order the
 * `CART_CHECKED_OUT` fence would then reject.

 * (`addressMode=zoned`) the country and region are HIDDEN — the destination the
 * totals were priced for — so they are always "filled" and must not make a
 * blank address look partial: only the typed fields count, and the hidden pair
 * joins them. On a page with no zones the country is a select the buyer fills
 * in, and it counts like any typed field.
 *
