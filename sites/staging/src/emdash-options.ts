/**
 * The emdash() integration options for the staging site — a pure builder
 * so the site-config test can assert the whole trusted-registration
 * surface (plan D6):
 *  - D1 (`DB`) with `session` OFF — it MUST stay off while wrangler.jsonc
 *    carries `global_fetch_strictly_public` (required for the site's
 *    Worker→*.workers.dev service subrequests; combining the two deadlocks
 *    every SSR request, silently — em-dash cloudflare.mdx:121-130, #1273).
 *    Read replication was inert anyway (not enabled account-side). Pinned
 *    by the pairing-invariant test in site-config.test.ts.
 *  - R2 (`MEDIA`) — zero-config media storage.
 *  - The Otta plugin registered TRUSTED via a hand-written descriptor
 *    (ADR-0006). Deliberately NO `sandboxed:`, NO `sandboxRunner:` — the
 *    Worker-Loader sandbox is the Workers-Paid cost pivot this deployment
 *    avoids — and no cloudflareImages/Stream/Access (paid / not needed:
 *    default passkey+password auth with the first-boot setup wizard).
 *  - The React console (`otta-console`) registered as a SECOND descriptor in
 *    the SAME array (ADR-0014). Two entries, one kind of registration: still
 *    `plugins: []`, still no sandbox runner.

/**
 * @param egress THE IN-PROCESS EGRESS URLS, threaded rather than read from the
 *   plugin's own resolver — and the omission was a real hole (review round 3,
 *   B1). The plugin bundle resolves `__OTTA_EMAIL_API_URL__` and
 *   `__OTTA_X402_FACILITATOR_URL__` from Vite defines (`manifest.ts`), and Vite
 *   substitutes defines when it bundles the WORKER; it does not touch
 *   `astro.config.ts`, which Node evaluates at config time, before any bundling.
 *   The DESCRIPTOR's `allowedHosts` is built HERE, in that Node pass. With no
 *   parameter for them the descriptor could never allowlist either host, so the
 *   first person to add one of those defines would ship a bundle holding a live
 *   `EmailSender` aimed at a host the gate refuses: every send fails, rows
 *   reschedule and park `failed`, and the sweep leg reports `count: 0` rather
 *   than the honest `skipped` — the exact failure `manifest.ts`'s
 *   `resolveInProcessEgress` note documents.
 *
 *   Same const, both consumers, one decision. The cannot-disagree test in
 *   site-config.test.ts pins it by reading `astro.config.ts` AS SOURCE and
 *   requiring that the identifier the two defines are baked from is the
 *   identifier passed here. It has to work that way: `emdash()` captures its
 *   options in a closure, so the registered descriptor is not reachable from a
 *   test, and rebuilding it from the baked values would compare two values
 *   derived from one input and stay green for the very omission described above
 *   (review round 3, A3). With nothing configured the resolved allowlist is
 *   Stripe's API host alone.
