/**
 * THE IN-PROCESS EGRESS URLS — resolved ONCE, here (review round 3, B1).
 *
 * These are two URLs and two consumers. The plugin BUNDLE reads them as Vite
 * defines (`manifest.ts`: `__OTTA_EMAIL_API_URL__`,
 * `__OTTA_X402_FACILITATOR_URL__`) to decide whether to build an `EmailSender` and
 * a facilitator client at all. The registered DESCRIPTOR needs the same two values
 * to put their hosts on `allowedHosts` — and `allowedHosts` is the one ADR-0006
 * gate that still bites in trusted mode. Feed only the defines and you get a
 * bundle that sends email to a host the gate refuses: every send fails, rows
 * reschedule and park `failed`, and the cron leg reports `count: 0` instead of the
 * honest `skipped`. So one const, both consumers.
 *
 * URLS, NEVER SECRETS. The API credentials that ride them live in write-only
 * plugin kv (the `settings:` keys `payment-secrets.ts` owns), provisioned through
 * the admin Settings form — which is what keeps wrangler-config.test.ts's
 * /SECRET|KEY|TOKEN|PASSWORD/i ban on `vars` intact and unroutable-around, and
 * why site-config.test.ts can assert this file names none of them.
 *
 * UNSET IS THE DEFAULT AND IT IS FAIL-CLOSED, not broken: the define bakes `""`,
 * which `hostnameOf` yields no host for, so `resolveInProcessEgress` reports the
 * provider unconfigured and `resolveAllowedHosts` grants nothing for it. Staging
 * today sets neither, so its allowlist is the Stripe API host alone — order email
 * is a capability this deployment does not yet have, and setting `EMAIL_API_URL`
 * at build time is the whole of turning it on.
