/**
 * The three catalog pages, after increment 3 of the theme rollout
 * (docs/theme/TEMPERED.md §7, §8, §10, §11).
 *
 * There is no render harness for PAGES in this package — a page reads the CMS
 * and dispatches a plugin route in its frontmatter, neither of which the
 * Container API can stand up (issue #40) — so these are source assertions, the
 * same pattern `footer-currency.test.ts` and `json-ld-xss.test.ts` use. That is
 * enough for the three things worth breaking a build over here:
 *
 *  1. §7 — no page assembles a money string. Prices arrive pre-formatted.
 *  2. §8 — the home hero omits the tape entirely when commerce is unreachable,
 *     rather than rendering an error box on a page nobody asked a price of.
 *  3. The PDP's add-to-cart form still carries the plugin's idempotency key and
 *     the ids the /cart/add endpoint needs. The theme restyled that form; it
 *     must not have quietly changed what it posts.
 *
 * What is NOT here: the tape's rows, the catalog counts and the headline
 * fallbacks. Those moved to `src/lib/tape.ts` and are covered BEHAVIOURALLY in
 * `tape.test.ts` — a grep for `slice(0, TAPE_ROWS)` proved a line existed, not
 * that a seventh product was dropped.
 *
 * Rendered behaviour (layout, focus rings, the dark palette) is verified in a
 * workerd preview with screenshots, and is not what this file is for.
