/**
 * §5 (storefront-checkout plan) — the cart page's money cells, and the missing
 * test the plan calls out: NOTHING in `sites/staging/test/` exercised the cart
 * page at all, which is how the em-dash symptom shipped unnoticed.
 *
 * The reported bug ("every money column shows —") was never a pricing-code bug.
 * `buildCartPricing`'s first gate short-circuits any line whose `productId` is
 * null (legacy bare adds made before #80 was deployed; the cart cookie lives 30
 * days, so a QA browser still points at one), and that path is SILENT BY
 * DESIGN: `degraded` stays false, so no banner renders, every cell falls to
 * "—", and the total row is suppressed. A visually identical failure comes from
 * a stale worker bundle, where `result.pricing` is `undefined` and the page's
 * `pricing?.degraded` check quietly evaluates to nothing.
 *
 * Both are indistinguishable from an outage at the page, which is the same
 * dishonesty the checkout's "Not calculated" rule exists to prevent. So the
 * decision is a pure function, tested here, and the page is pinned to use it.
 *
 * (No render/DOM harness exists in this package — plan §7.3 / issue #40. The
 * decision is extracted precisely so it can be asserted without one.)
