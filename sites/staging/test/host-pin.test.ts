/**
 * One copy of the host is an invariant, not a preference. Otta's commerce truth
 * rides on EmDash's conditional-write primitives, which first shipped in `emdash@0.38.0`.
 * The released `@emdash-cms/cloudflare` pins `emdash` EXACTLY, so if a future
 * release of it ever pins a version other than the one the manifests name, a
 * second `emdash` lands in the store and the Worker bridge binds to the copy
 * WITHOUT the primitives: no install error, no type error. This suite is what
 * makes that loud. The fix, if it ever fires, is an exact `emdash` override in
 * `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
