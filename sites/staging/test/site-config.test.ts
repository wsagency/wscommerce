/**
 * Site-config tests (plan §3.1): the trusted-registration surface of the
 * staging site. The descriptor builder and the emdash options are pure
 * modules precisely so this file can pin them:
 *  - the Otta plugin descriptor is standard-format, entrypoint
 *    `@otta-sh/plugin/plugin`, capabilities EXACTLY the manifest's, and its
 *    allowedHosts is exactly the in-process egress list — Stripe's API host
 *    plus whichever of the email/facilitator hosts the deployment supplied
 *    (the egress gate that holds even in trusted mode — ADR-0006);
 *  - NO `sandboxed:` / `sandboxRunner:` keys (a LOADER-consuming sandbox
 *    runner is the Workers-Paid cost pivot this deployment avoids);
 *  - database/storage are d1(DB, session OFF — paired with wrangler's
 *    global_fetch_strictly_public flag) / r2(MEDIA);
 *  - Astro `security.checkOrigin` is never disabled BY US — note the emdash
 *    integration force-disables it platform-wide and substitutes a CSRF
 *    layer covering only /_emdash/api/* routes, so the real cart-endpoint
 *    CSRF pin is origin-guard.test.ts (see ADR-0006);
 *  - `vite.ssr.noExternal` contains "@otta-sh/plugin" UNCONDITIONALLY: if the
 *    plugin is externalized the `__OTTA_EMAIL_API_URL__` /
 *    `__OTTA_X402_FACILITATOR_URL__` defines silently never apply and every
 *    ctx.http call fails against allowedHosts at runtime. It also contains
 *    "@otta-sh/admin-react", whose workspace exports are TS/TSX source;
 *  - and, since INC-19, ADR-0014's SECOND descriptor `otta-console` — its own
 *    block below.

 * collections its DESCRIPTOR declared — `collectionOf` throws "storage collection
 * '<name>' is not declared" for anything else. So the descriptor is not
 * documentation here; it is the schema.
 *
 * AND THE INDEX LISTS ARE PART OF IT. A declared index is a READ CONTRACT: the
 * host validates every `where`/`orderBy` field against this declaration and
 * REFUSES an undeclared one at runtime (`storage-query.ts`: "Add '<field>' to
 * storage.<collection>.indexes"). A descriptor that named all 36 collections but
 * dropped one index would not be slower — `orders` would stop being listable by
 * state, and it would fail in production, not in the build. That is why every
 * assertion below compares the WHOLE map or the WHOLE index list, never a subset.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS TRANSCRIBED. The expected value is `COMMERCE_STORAGE_COLLECTIONS`
 * itself — the union `@otta-sh/plugin` assembles from the twelve per-adapter
 * declarations — rather than a hand-copied snapshot that would rot.
 *
 * AND BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT THAT COSTS (review round 3, B4). `commerceStorage()`
 * returns that import BY REFERENCE, so every `toEqual` below is comparing an
 * object with itself and CANNOT detect the adapters and the descriptor drifting
 * apart — no assertion phrased this way ever could, because there is only one
 * value. What these cases are is a REGRESSION GUARD in one direction: the day
 * someone replaces the spread with a literal list, or drops a collection on the
 * way through, or lets the in-process arm stop declaring storage at all, these
 * stop passing. That is worth having; it is just not drift detection, and the

/**
 * THE COVERAGE LINK — the console's page list and its Playwright gate, tied
 * together mechanically.
 *
 * Without this, the console's two halves are only related by intent. The console
 * declares its pages in `@otta-sh/admin-react`; the Playwright coverage gate
 * reads `MIGRATED_SCREENS` in `sites/staging/e2e/`. Nothing made adding to the
 * first require adding to the second, so INC-20 could ship an Orders page,
 * generate NO smoke spec for it, and see every gate go green — the precise
 * failure `console-screens.spec.ts` was written to make impossible, arriving
 * through the one door it does not watch.
 *
 * THE ESCAPE HATCH IS GONE, and that is a tightening. The gated set used to be
 * `MIGRATED_SCREENS` PLUS the console shell, because the shell was a React page
 * that replaced no Block Kit screen and so did not belong in a registry counting
 * migrations. ADR-0015 removed that page, and with it the only page this check
 * had to admit by name. Every page the console serves is now a migrated screen,
 * so the registry alone is the gate and a new console page has exactly one way
 * to pass: be registered, and therefore get a generated smoke spec.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in the e2e surface because this file already
 * imports both sides, and because `pnpm test` is the gate hardest to skip.
