# @otta-sh/site-staging

The EmDash Commerce **reference storefront and admin**: an EmDash site on Cloudflare Workers backed by
a D1 content database and an R2 media bucket, with the Otta plugin registered **trusted
in-process**. See [ADR-0006](../../adr/0006-trusted-in-process-deployment.md) for why that is
allowed and what stays forbidden.

Pages are thin theme shims per [ADR-0003](../../adr/0003-storefront-plugin-routes.md): the
CMS query runs in the page, the plugin's public routes return JSON view models in-process
(`locals.emdash.handlePublicPluginApiRoute`), the page renders HTML. The `/cart/*` POST
endpoints own the `otta_cart` cookie (the plugin returns a cookie *descriptor*; the
endpoint applies it verbatim) and forward form-embedded idempotency keys — they never mint
one at POST time, so a double-submit replays instead of duplicating.

## Local development

```bash
pnpm --filter @otta-sh/site-staging dev
```

Nothing else has to be running: commerce is **in-process** in this site's own Worker
(ADR-0006), so there is no second process to start and no service URL to point at.

In `astro dev` the fastest path to a populated catalog is the dev-only bypass, which
applies the full seed including the 3 sample products:
`/_emdash/api/setup/dev-bypass?redirect=/_emdash/admin`. What first boot does and does
not seed in a real deployment is covered in [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](../../DEPLOYMENT.md) §2.2.

### Plugin settings are namespaced by plugin id

A setting saved under one plugin id is not visible to another. The Block Kit screens and the
React console both read `otta`'s.

### Running the stack from a non-interactive shell (agents, CI sandboxes)

`astro dev` is a long-running foreground process: started in the usual way it holds the
terminal and never returns. In an automated or agent-driven environment, start it **detached**
and wait until it reports its URL before driving it — a request issued before the server is
listening fails in a way that looks like an application error.

`STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` is read by the process that starts, not per request: it is baked as a
Vite `define`. **Changing it means restarting the dev server** — there is no runtime
override, in dev any more than in production. Setting it in a later shell has no effect on a
server that is already up.

## The STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY build-time contract

The checkout's Payment Element needs a Stripe **publishable** key, baked in
`astro.config.ts` as a Vite `define`: shell env → `sites/staging/.env` → absent.
**Changing it means rebuild + redeploy.** The variable is **`STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`** — the name
matters, see below. It is not put in wrangler `vars` because the guard test forbids any
`vars` key matching `/SECRET|KEY|TOKEN|PASSWORD/i`, and that guard is worth keeping.

Three behaviours, deliberately distinct:

| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | What happens |
|---|---|
| a valid `pk_test_…` / `pk_live_…` | full checkout: review → pay → confirmation |
| **unset** | Card payment is unavailable. Enabled bank transfer/COD can still create pending orders; their authenticated receipt actions supply payment evidence. |
| set but malformed | **the build FAILS** |

That last row is the point. An absent key and a *misspelt variable name* look identical at
runtime — both degrade quietly while a valid key may sit unread — so a present-but-malformed
value throws instead of degrading, and `test/checkout-config.test.ts` pins the variable's
exact spelling as test data. See [ADR-0012](../../adr/0012-storefront-checkout-loads-stripe-elements-in-the-browser.md).

**A build without the key tree-shakes the payment step away entirely** (the branch is
constant-folded). That is correct, but it means any QA of the payment step must build *with*
the key.

## Deploying

The deploy runbook for this site lives in the root [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](../../DEPLOYMENT.md):
resource creation, the build/deploy ordering, first boot + claim, and failed-first-boot
recovery are §2; the `global_fetch_strictly_public` ⇒ D1-`session`-off pairing invariant is
§2.4; the secrets checklist is §3. Provision `EMDASH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` before first boot
and the optional `OTTA_WH_TOKEN` webhook edge gate. Existing Stripe/email settings use
the authenticated console. New Solo/e-racuni/Woo credentials use server runtime bindings;
see [.dev.vars.example](.dev.vars.example) and [integration setup](../../docs/integrations.md).
Production deployment and external account acceptance remain separate gates.

## Notes

- **The checkout is built** (ADR-0012): `/checkout` (review + honest totals + contact and
  ship-to), `POST /checkout/place`, `/checkout/pay` (the Payment Element — the site's only
  third-party script, `js.stripe.com` its only third-party origin; the one other client
  script is the hold ribbon's bundled countdown, `src/components/HoldRibbon.astro`), and
  `/orders/<orderId>` (the capability-URL confirmation page, which polls with a bounded
  `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` and never claims "paid" on the strength of Stripe's
  redirect — verified settlement supplies payment evidence). Bank transfer and COD
  freeze their instructions and due dates into the order. COD acceptance permits dispatch
  while unpaid; a receipt records the exact frozen amount/currency. Declared variants
  have independent SKU/price/stock, managed in the authenticated Pricing & inventory
  screen and selected before adding to the cart. `POST /checkout/new-cart` is the way out
  of the dead-cart trap. Browser-to-Stripe traffic is separate from the plugin's scoped egress.
  Native inventory keeps cart/order reservations and durable replay claims; commercial
  writes must use its ports rather than raw CMS stock fields.
- **Accounting compatibility:** `/wp-json` and `/wp-json/wc/v3` expose the documented
  scoped Woo REST profile, including frozen order/variant amounts and signed durable
  created/updated webhooks. These are remote protocol interfaces; PHP Woo plugins do not
  execute in this site. Direct Solo/e-racuni invoice jobs are disabled by default and
  have a single configured owner. See [profile](../../packages/compat-woocommerce/README.md)
  and [operations](../../docs/operations.md) for recovery and live acceptance.
- **Still a follow-up:** the x402 payment gate (designed to live at THIS Astro page layer)
  and the digital-download delivery page (the plugin route authorizes; the site serves the
  bytes / signed URL). Note for that task: `entitlements/download` is a public existence oracle
  (it confirms whether an orderId/buyerRef/sku combination is entitled) — the delivery
  page must rate-limit and/or tokenize access to it rather than exposing raw probing.
- **Customer account pages (issue #306, ADR-0004).** Magic-link sign-in:
  `/account/login` (email form → `POST /account/login/request` → the same generic
  "if an account exists…" notice for every address), `/account/verify` (where the
  emailed link lands — it renders a button and redeems NOTHING on the GET, so a
  mail scanner's pre-fetch cannot spend the single-use token; `POST
  /account/verify/confirm` redeems it and applies the plugin's session-cookie
  descriptor verbatim, HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite=Lax), `/account/orders` and
  `/account/orders/<id>` (read through the session; guest orders under the same
  address are claimed at sign-in), and `POST /account/logout` (revokes server-side,
  always clears the cookie). Every POST runs the origin guard first; account pages
  are `private, no-store`. The header carries a theme-owned "Account" link unless the
  CMS menu already links into `/account`. Saved addresses
  (`storefront/account/addresses`) have no page yet.
  **Operator setup, required for sign-in:** in the plugin's Settings, set **Sign-in link
  page** (`settings:loginLinkUrl`) to this site's absolute verify URL, e.g.
  `https://shop.example/account/verify`. The emailed link points there and nowhere else.
  The request's origin is never used, because a spoofed `Host` could otherwise aim a
  victim's link at another domain. While the setting is unset, the login form still
  shows its generic notice but no link is sent, and the plugin logs that once.
- No secrets anywhere in this package: `.env` is gitignored, `.env.example` holds
  placeholders, `wrangler.jsonc` `vars` must never grow a secret-shaped key (pinned by
  `test/wrangler-config.test.ts`).
