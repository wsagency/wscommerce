/**
 * Price, stock and activate the demo products the seed creates, so the
 * quickstart ends at "buy", not at "browse".
 *
 * WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS. em-dash's seed applier writes content through
 * `ContentRepository` directly and fires NO content hooks, so the demo products
 * never produce a `product_commerce` row — the plugin's sync hooks are simply
 * never invoked for them. That was true before "one home per field" (PR 1b) and
 * is still true after it: a seeded product is content-only. Without this step a
 * new reader lands on `/products`, sees three products, and cannot buy any of
 * them.
 *
 * WHERE IT WRITES, AND WHY THAT CHANGED (INC-D1). It used to drive the
 * standalone commerce service's REST API (`PUT /products/:id/commerce`, then
 * `POST …/commerce/activate`). Staging now runs commerce IN-PROCESS: there is no
 * service to call, commerce truth lives in em-dash plugin storage inside the
 * site's own Worker, and every write goes through the SITE. So `SITE_URL` is now
 * the only address this script needs — `COMMERCE_SERVICE_URL` and
 * `SERVICE_API_TOKEN` are gone, and one credential (the em-dash one) now covers
 * both halves of the job.
 *
 * THE WRITE PATH IS THREE SURFACES, NOT ONE, AND THE SPLIT IS DELIBERATE. The
 * in-process admin route refuses to write `title` or `active` at all — not by
 * policy check but STRUCTURALLY: `ProductEditWire` has no member for either,
 * because both are CMS-owned (ADR-0013, "one home per field"). So the flow is:
 *
 *   1. READ the row first (`otta_console_read` / `products.detail`). This is the
 *      re-run guard, and it comes FIRST — see the next paragraph, which is the
 *      whole reason the order is written down here.
 *   2. PUBLISH the product through the CMS content API, but ONLY on the path
 *      that is about to price it. That fires the plugin's own
 *      `content:afterPublish` hook, which upserts the `product_commerce` row
 *      WITH its title and opens the publish gate. This is the only door `title`
 *      and `active` have, and using it means the row is created by exactly the
 *      code path a real merchant's first publish would take. Then re-read, for
 *      the row the hook just created and the `expectedUpdatedAt` the write needs.
 *   3. SKU + price (`otta_console_act` / `products:save-identity`), then stock
 *      (`products:restock`). Both are the same envelopes the React console
 *      posts; this script is just another client of the admin route.
 *
 * Step 2 is not optional sequencing: `updateProduct` answers
 * `{ok:false, reason:"not_found"}` when no `product_commerce` row exists, so
 * pricing genuinely cannot precede the publish that creates the row.
 *
 * WHY THE READ MUST PRECEDE THE PUBLISH, AND IT IS NOT AN OPTIMISATION. A
 * publish is not a read-only probe: it opens the publish gate. A merchant who
 * priced a product and then deliberately UNPUBLISHED it would have it silently
 * put back on sale by a publish-then-decide flow — the skip would be taken one
 * call too late, after the damage. Reading first costs one extra round trip on a
 * first run (the row does not exist yet, which the console answers as
 * `ok:false` / `product:null`, mapped to `null` by `parseExistingCommerce`) and
 * makes "this script never re-activates what it did not price" structurally
 * true rather than merely claimed.
 *
 * THE TITLE IS NO LONGER THIS SCRIPT'S TO WRITE, AND THAT IS THE FIX. The old
 * revision hand-carried `title` on the upsert body because no hook fired for a
 * seeded product and a null title makes `createOrderFromCart` reject the line
 * with `PRODUCT_NOT_PRICED` — listed, priced, active and impossible to buy, with
 * the failure invisible until the last step of checkout. Publishing through the
 * CMS fires the hook, so the title arrives from its actual owner and this script
 * never becomes a second writer of it.
 *
 * THE ACTIVATE WATERMARK IS GONE FOR THE SAME REASON. The previous flow sent a
 * hand-built UNIX-epoch `contentUpdatedAt` so that every later real lifecycle
 * event would carry a strictly newer watermark and win. The publish hook carries
 * the content's OWN `updatedAt`, which is that guarantee by construction rather
 * than by a constant chosen to be older than everything.
 *
 * RE-RUNNING IS SAFE, AND IDEMPOTENCY KEYS ARE NOT WHAT MAKES IT SO. Each
 * product is READ first and skipped — before ANY write, publish included — if
 * its row already has a SKU; see `shouldPrice`. Without that read a second run
 * would silently overwrite a merchant's prices. The admin route derives its own
 * keys from the submitted payload, so a re-run with the SAME demo values does
 * dedupe — but a re-run after a merchant repriced does not, because the payload
 * differs. `shouldPrice` is the actual guard; the keys are a courtesy.
 * Re-publishing (step 2) is separately safe on the path that reaches it: em-dash
 * re-promotes the live revision and the sync hook's upsert is ordering-guarded
 * by `contentUpdatedAt`.
 *
 * WHY THE IDS COME FROM THE CMS AND NOT FROM `seed/seed.json`. **A seed entry's
 * `id` is not the stored id.** em-dash's seed applier generates a ULID for every
 * entry and keeps the declared id only as a seed-local reference
 * (`seedIdMap: seed id -> real entry id`, `packages/core/src/seed/apply.ts`), so
 * `product:otta-tee` never exists in the content database. Addressing commerce
 * with it would mint rows no CMS product will ever join to, leaving the
 * storefront showing "Not currently available for purchase" with no error
 * anywhere. So the ids are resolved from the CMS at run time, matched by SLUG.
 * `seed/seed.json` remains the source of truth for WHICH products get priced,
 * and a slug it declares that the CMS does not have is a hard error.
 *
 * USAGE
 *
 *   # after the site's seed has been applied
 *   SITE_URL=http://localhost:4321 pnpm dlx tsx@4 \
 *     sites/staging/scripts/seed-demo-commerce.ts
 *
 * AUTH — ONE credential, for reads and writes alike, because everything now goes
 * through the site. Set `EMDASH_TOKEN` to an em-dash API token (sent as
 * `Authorization: Bearer …`); it needs `content:publish_own`/`publish_any` for
 * step 1 and `plugins:manage` with ADMIN scope for steps 2-3. With no token the
 * script falls back to `/_emdash/api/auth/dev-bypass`, which signs in as the dev
 * admin and does nothing else. That route IS registered in a production build —
 * it just returns 403 there — so a deployed site needs `EMDASH_TOKEN`.
 *
 * Session-cookie auth additionally needs em-dash's CSRF header on every non-GET
 * (`X-EmDash-Request: 1`); bearer tokens are exempt from it. The script sends it
 * unconditionally on writes, which is correct for both.

 *
 * Re-publishing an already-published entry is SAFE and is the normal case on a
 * re-run over a bare, still-unpriced row: em-dash re-promotes the current live
 * revision, preserves the original `published_at`, and still fires the hook —
 * whose upsert is ordering-guarded by `contentUpdatedAt`, so it cannot move a
 * row backwards.
 *
 * No request body: `publishedAt` would be a backdate (and would demand
 * `content:publish_any`), and this script has no business choosing one.
