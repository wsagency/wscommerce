				"is the injected ctx.http; its commerce truth is the injected ctx.storage " +
				"(DEVELOPMENT.md §5, ADR-0018, sandbox-clean guard). The forbidden list is " +
				"a superset of domain-is-io-free's, plus HTTP/WS client libs (undici, " +
				"node-fetch, axios, ws). Test helpers (test/) are exempt — they run in " +
				"Node, driving the sandbox from outside it. Complemented by the " +
				"direct-fetch grep guard in " +
				"packages/plugin/test/sandbox-clean-guard.test.ts (depcruise can't see " +
				"ambient globals like workerd's own fetch), and executed case by case in " +
				"packages/plugin/test/depcruise-boundary.test.ts, which cruises THIS file " +
				"over planted imports and asserts the rule name each one trips. The " +
				"node-builtin half reads `^(node:)?…` because dependency-cruiser reports " +
				'`import ... from "node:fs"` under the BARE module name `fs`: a ' +
				"`^node:`-only clause matches nothing, so this rule silently permitted " +
				"every builtin it names, from the day it was written until INC-21. " +
				"`domain-is-io-free` above always had the correct form, which is why " +
				"the two rules disagreed about the same import. It still forbids " +
				"@otta-sh/admin-react, in all three spellings: without that, the console " +
				"quarantine below is escapable in ONE HOP — packages/plugin importing " +
				"packages/admin-react trips no rule, and react/emdash then reach the " +
				"plugin transitively, which is precisely what ADR-0014 Decision 1 " +
				"forbids.\n\n" +
				"TWO things this rule USED to forbid and deliberately no longer does " +
				"(ADR-0018). First, @otta-sh/domain, which was named in all three " +
				"@otta-sh clauses. The boundary was never `the plugin must not know the " +
				"domain`; it was `the plugin must not acquire IO`, and banning the domain " +
				"was a cheap PROXY for that — cheap because the domain is the package " +
				"most likely to grow an adapter import. The proxy is no longer needed and " +
				"was blocking the thing ADR-0002 designed for: the domain has zero " +
				"runtime dependencies and zero node: imports, and `domain-is-io-free` " +
				"above enforces exactly that, on every commit, as this rule's premise. " +
				"Importing the domain therefore cannot put IO inside the isolate; " +
				"importing an ADAPTER can, which is why every adapter except one stays " +
				"banned. Second, that one exception: `store-[^/]+` in the packages clause " +
				"became `(?!store-emdash/)store-[^/]+`, so packages/store-emdash is " +
				"admitted while any other store-* — including any added later — is banned " +
				"by default rather than by anyone remembering to add it — and the same list " +
				"is mirrored into the two SPECIFIER clauses, not only the packages " +
				"clause, because pnpm's strict isolation leaves an UNDECLARED import as " +
				"a bare specifier that never resolves to a packages/ path: naming only " +
				"admin-react there meant an undeclared @otta-sh/store-* " +
				"or payments-* import tripped nothing at all, which is the same class of " +
				"silent miss as the `^node:`-only builtin clause. store-emdash is " +
				"admissible because it carries no IO of its own: it is written against a " +
				"structural StorageAccess port whose implementation arrives injected, and " +
				"three store-emdash-* rules below hold it to the same perimeter as this " +
				"one, type-only imports included.\n\n" +
				"THIRD NARROWING (work order 02, INC-C1b): `payments-[^/]+` became " +
				"`(?!payments-(stripe|x402)(/|$))payments-[^/]+`, in all three clauses, " +
				"so @otta-sh/payments-stripe and @otta-sh/payments-x402 are admitted and " +
				"every other payments-* package stays banned by default. The reason is " +
				"the same shape as store-emdash's, and it is a statement about those two " +
				"packages rather than about payment adapters generally: with the service " +
				"folded in there is no second deployable to verify a Stripe webhook in, " +
				"and an UNAUTHENTICATED webhook only ever reaches a plugin route " +
				"registered `public: true` — so the HMAC verification has to happen " +
				"inside the isolate. It can: payments-stripe's verifier is WebCrypto " +
				"(`crypto.subtle.verify`, an ambient global in workerd), it imports " +
				"nothing but @otta-sh/domain, and its own sandbox-clean guard " +
				"(packages/payments-stripe/test/sandbox-clean-guard.test.ts) holds it " +
				"there. A payments adapter that reached for `pg` or a node builtin would " +
				"still be caught — by the driver and node-builtin clauses of this same " +
				"rule, which the carve-out does not touch. " +
				"packages/plugin/test/depcruise-boundary.test.ts pins both halves: these " +
				"two admitted, a third payments-* package still forbidden.\n\n" +
				"FOURTH CHANGE (work order 02, INC-D3c): `service` is no longer named in " +
				"any of the three clauses, because @otta-sh/service no longer EXISTS — " +
				"INC-D3b deleted packages/service (and packages/store-postgres with it) " +
				"once the service was folded into the plugin. A ban on a package that " +
				"cannot be imported is a clause no fixture can exercise, so it rots " +
				"silently: nothing would notice if it stopped matching, which is the same " +
				"failure mode as the `^node:`-only builtin clause above. store-postgres " +
				"was never named literally — it was caught by the " +
				"`(?!store-emdash(/|$))store-[^/]+` lookahead, which is untouched and " +
				"still bans every store-* but the one, so a store-postgres reintroduced " +
				"tomorrow is forbidden on the day it is created. A reintroduced `service` " +
				"package would NOT be, and that is deliberate: after the fold-in " +
				"(ADR-0018) a second deployable is a decision that needs its own ADR, not " +
