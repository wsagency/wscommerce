# Deploying WSCommerce

How to stand up the Websolutions Commerce reference shop from a fresh clone. Architecture background lives in
[`README.md`](./README.md); design decisions in [`adr/`](./adr/). This guide is
self-contained — section references like "§2" point inside this file.

---

## 0. What you are deploying

WSCommerce is **one deployable and one database**: the storefront site (`sites/staging`) — an
EmDash CMS site with the Otta plugin registered trusted, running commerce **in-process**
inside the same Worker. There is no separate commerce service and no second database:
commerce truth lives in the host's per-plugin document store on the site's own D1 database,
alongside CMS content ([ADR-0018](./adr/0018-plugin-owns-commerce-truth-in-process.md),
[ADR-0019](./adr/0019-commerce-aggregates-are-one-document-each.md),
[ADR-0020](./adr/0020-one-deployable-plugin-owns-commerce-truth.md)).

`sites/staging` is the reference site: copy it for your own store rather than treating it as
staging-only.

The inherited package names and plugin ID remain `@otta-sh/*` and `otta`. Each
shop deploys its own Worker, database, media bucket and credentials. EmDash is
pinned to 1.0.1; see [validation](./docs/validation.md) for current local evidence.

The reference storefront includes catalog/variants, reserved carts, inclusive or
exclusive prices, separate billing, card checkout, bank transfer, COD and order
confirmation. Bank/COD require explicit settings and private receipt confirmation.
Accounts, discounts, shipping rules, refunds and reporting are native modules;
email requires a configured provider. Direct Solo/e-racuni and the selected Woo
REST/webhook profile require account acceptance before live use.

Digital entitlements do not yet provide a storefront file delivery page. x402
does not yet have a storefront payment gate. Carrier booking/labels, automatic
accounting corrections and arbitrary WordPress PHP plugins are not supplied.
This guide describes deployment; the implementation work did not deploy a shop
or execute real payment/accounting/carrier transactions.

## 1. Universal contracts

Three rules hold. Everything else in this guide is a consequence of them.

- **Deploy-then-claim.** A freshly deployed site is unclaimed: **the first visitor to
  complete the setup wizard becomes the admin.** Claim it immediately after the first
  request, in the same session. The wizard's passkey step requires a WebAuthn **secure
  context** — HTTPS, or `localhost` (see §2.2). If the unclaimed window worries
  you, front `/_emdash/*` with Cloudflare Access until setup is claimed, then remove it.
- **Seed reality.** The site's first request runs the CMS migrations and applies the seed's
  **schema, settings, and menus only**. Sample content (the 3 demo products) is applied
  **only** when the setup wizard is completed with "include sample content" checked. An
  empty `/products` page right after first boot is **healthy, not a failed boot**.
- **Secrets model.** There is one deployable, so there is one place secrets can live — and
  two stores inside it (§3). The inherited Worker secrets (`wrangler secret put`) are
  `EMDASH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `OTTA_WH_TOKEN`. Every payment and email **credential** is
  provisioned by the operator in the admin console's **Settings** page and held in
  **write-only plugin `kv`** under `settings:*` — persisted only on a non-empty submit,
  never rendered back into a block, read through a fail-closed reader. New
  Solo/e-racuni/Woo credentials use server-only Worker bindings instead (§3). Nothing
  secret-shaped ever goes in a tracked `wrangler.jsonc` (pinned by the site's config tests,
  which reject any `vars` key matching `/SECRET|KEY|TOKEN|PASSWORD/i`).

## 2. Cloudflare Workers

The site as a Worker, with commerce running in-process inside it. This shape is
the target of the reference site's build. This fork's current evidence is local
build/runtime validation; its production deployment remains an acceptance gate.

### 2.0 Resource configuration

The reference deployment uses these deliberate resource choices. Confirm the
selected account's current plans, generated bindings and quotas before release:

- **The plugin runs trusted in-process** — no `worker_loaders` binding. See
  [ADR-0006](./adr/0006-trusted-in-process-deployment.md) for why this is allowed and what
  stays forbidden.
- **Media lives in R2.** The site does not explicitly select
  `imageService: "cloudflare"`; inspect the current adapter's generated Images
  and session bindings as part of account provisioning. No video service is configured.

The site's minute cron maintains native state and can contact configured
invoice, email and webhook providers (§5). Usage depends on enabled integrations
and shop traffic; this guide does not promise a free production deployment.

### 2.1 The site Worker

1. **Create the content resources** (from `sites/staging`):

   ```bash
   wrangler whoami                                # confirm the right account
   wrangler d1 create YOUR-D1-DATABASE-NAME       # prints the database_id to paste in
   wrangler r2 bucket create your-media-bucket
   ```

2. **Fill in the local config.** Copy `sites/staging/wrangler.jsonc` (also a template) to
   `wrangler.local.jsonc` (gitignored) and set your Worker `name` (over `my-otta-store`),
   D1 `database_name`/`database_id`, and R2 `bucket_name`. Leave the
   `global_fetch_strictly_public` compatibility flag alone — §2.4 explains it.

3. **Set the site's one secret** (the only secret first boot needs):

   ```bash
   npx emdash secrets generate
   wrangler secret put EMDASH_ENCRYPTION_KEY --config wrangler.local.jsonc   # paste; back it up
   ```

   The site's "never `--config`" rule (step 5) applies to **deploy only** — deploy must
   follow the build's `.wrangler/deploy` redirect. `wrangler secret put` never reads that
   redirect: without `--config` it defaults to the tracked template and targets a Worker
   named `my-otta-store` — a phantom; your real Worker would then first-boot without its
   only required secret.

4. **Build the site.** The Cloudflare adapter reads `wrangler.local.jsonc` at **build**
   time (`astro.config.ts` passes it as `configPath`), so the build, not the deploy, is
   where your Worker name, D1, and R2 config becomes real. Commerce runs in-process, so
   there is no service URL to bake in; the optional email and x402 provider URLs are read
   here too, together with public invoice/Woo egress origins (§4):

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @otta-sh/site-staging build
   ```

5. **Deploy plain — never `--config` here** (from `sites/staging`):

   ```bash
   wrangler deploy
   ```

   This follows the `.wrangler/deploy` redirect to the adapter-generated dist config, which
   already carries your `wrangler.local.jsonc` values from step 4's build. **Deploy does not
   rebuild** — step 4 owns the build, so your Worker name, D1, and R2 bindings are never
   silently the tracked template's placeholders.

### 2.2 First boot and claim

1. **Hit the site once** — `https://<your-worker>.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/`. The first
   request runs the CMS migrations and applies the seed's schema/settings/menus (one-time
   latency is expected). Per §1, `/products` is empty at this point — that is healthy.
2. **Claim immediately:** open `/_emdash/admin` and complete the setup wizard **in the same
   session, with "include sample content" enabled** (that is what applies the 3 sample
   products; skip it and you simply start with an empty catalog). The first visitor to
   complete setup becomes the admin — do not deploy and walk away. workers.dev is HTTPS, so
   the passkey step's secure-context requirement (§1) is already met.
3. **Smoke:** `/products` renders the sample catalog (or the friendly empty state); create
   and publish a product in the admin and watch `wrangler tail` log the sync upsert; price
   it in the admin's **Pricing & inventory** page (the CMS holds no commercial data);
   add-to-cart sets the `otta_cart` cookie and creates a hold. The three sample products
   are content-only until you price them — the seed fires no content hooks, so either
   price them in Pricing & inventory or run `sites/staging/scripts/seed-demo-commerce.ts`
   against the SITE. It drives the site's own admin API — the route the Pricing &
   inventory page uses — so it needs only the site URL and a token that can read the CMS
   and call that route:

   ```bash
   SITE_URL=https://<your-site-worker>.workers.dev \
   EMDASH_TOKEN=<an admin API token> \
     pnpm dlx tsx@4 sites/staging/scripts/seed-demo-commerce.ts
   ```

   The script is safe to re-run: it reads each product first and skips any that already
   has a SKU, so it never overwrites a price set in Pricing & inventory.
4. **`wrangler tail`** (from `sites/staging`) — first boot should be clean: migrations +
   schema seed, no errors.

### 2.3 Failed-first-boot recovery

For an actual failed first boot, retain the migration/setup error and inspect the database
before retrying. An empty `/products` catalog is expected before adding products (§2.2 step 1).
Preserve the existing database and its backup as diagnostic/recovery evidence.

If initial setup cannot resume and this is a disposable first installation with no customer
or commerce data, provision a fresh database with `wrangler d1 create YOUR-NEW-DATABASE-NAME`.
Update `database_id` in `wrangler.local.jsonc`, **rebuild**, redeploy and claim the admin
(§2.1 step 5 → §2.2). Keep the old database until the new installation is verified.
An existing shop needs migration repair or a qualified restore using [operations](docs/operations.md).

### 2.4 The `global_fetch_strictly_public` pairing invariant

> The site's `wrangler.jsonc` carries the `global_fetch_strictly_public` compatibility flag.
> That flag silently breaks the D1 Sessions API — its internal routing request is blocked and
> **every SSR request hangs with nothing in the logs** — so `d1()` in the site config must
> keep `session` **off** while the flag is present. Both halves are pinned by tests:
> `sites/staging/test/site-config.test.ts` (session stays off, placeholder equality) and
> `sites/staging/test/wrangler-config.test.ts` (flag presence, template hygiene). Do not
> "fix" one side without the other.
>
> A **custom domain** on the site (issue #32) is what unlocks zone-level WAF rules.

## 3. Secrets & tokens checklist

The inherited payment/email settings are **plugin credentials** the operator
types into the admin console's **Settings** page, which
persists them to write-only plugin `kv` under `settings:*`. On Workers, **every `wrangler
secret put` below** needs `--config wrangler.local.jsonc`: without it, wrangler defaults to
the tracked template and uploads the secret to the placeholder-named Worker, not yours. In
order of appearance in a deployment's life:

| Secret | Where it lives | Required? | When to set |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EMDASH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Worker secret | yes | before the site's first boot |
| `OTTA_WH_TOKEN` | Worker secret **+** admin Settings (same value, both halves) | optional outer gate on the settle routes | with the Stripe webhook secret |
| Stripe webhook signing secret | admin Settings (`settings:stripeWebhookSecret`) | for Stripe payments — **together with the secret key** (see below) | before enabling Stripe |
| Stripe secret key | admin Settings (`settings:stripeSecretKey`) | for Stripe payments — **together with the webhook secret** (see below) | before enabling Stripe |
| x402 pay-to + facilitator credential | admin Settings | for x402 | see the x402 box |
| Email API key + from-address (with the `EMAIL_API_URL` build-time value, §4) | admin Settings (from-address in `settings:emailFrom`) | optional | when wiring real email |
| Solo API token | Worker binding `SOLO_API_TOKEN` | for direct Solo ownership | after provider account acceptance |
| e-racuni username, secret and organization token | Worker bindings `ERACUNI_USERNAME`, `ERACUNI_SECRET_KEY`, `ERACUNI_ORG_TOKEN` | for direct e-racuni ownership | after provider account acceptance |
| Woo consumer key/secret and optional webhook secret/destination | Worker bindings `WOO_CONSUMER_KEY`, `WOO_CONSUMER_SECRET`, `WOO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `WOO_WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_URL` | for the remote REST connector | before connector acceptance |

Set these new runtime bindings with `wrangler secret put NAME --config
wrangler.local.jsonc`. This uses the same real-Worker selection as the encryption
key; deployment still follows the build redirect in §2.1. For local development,
copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` inside `sites/staging`. These ignored
files are server configuration, and their credentials never enter browser state
or plugin status responses.

Choose one `INVOICE_OWNER`: `disabled`, `solo`, `e-racuni` or
`woocommerce-connector`. Direct issuance also requires `INVOICE_LIVE_ENABLED=true`
after acceptance; credentials alone do not enable it. Configure stable
`COMMERCE_SHOP_ID` and canonical `COMMERCE_PUBLIC_URL` bindings. Put only public
endpoint origins in the build-time egress configuration (§4); a provider-issued
webhook destination may contain a secret and belongs in runtime bindings.
See [integration configuration and acceptance](./docs/integrations.md) for the
complete table, supported invoice profile and connector instructions.

- **`EMDASH_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** — generate with `npx emdash secrets generate`; never committed,
  never echoed into logs; **back it up in a password manager** (it protects the CMS's
  encrypted data — losing it strands that data).

> **The Stripe webhook endpoint is public by design, and permanently site-owned.**
> Stripe delivers to `POST /webhooks/stripe` on the site (`sites/staging/src/pages/webhooks/stripe.ts`)
> — register **that** path in the Stripe dashboard, subscribed to
> `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `refund.created`,
> `refund.updated` and `refund.failed`. Refund HTTP acceptance does not prove
> completion: signed refund events update the native lifecycle. Unbound external
> refunds are ignored; incomplete events for native refunds fail closed.
> It is a transport shim: it reads the raw
> delivered bytes, never parses them, attaches the edge token, and dispatches the plugin's
> **public** `webhooks/stripe/settle` route in-process, replaying the status the plugin asks
> for so Stripe's retry behaviour stays correct. It holds no Stripe secret and verifies no
> signature itself.
>
> **The trust anchor is the Stripe HMAC**, verified unconditionally inside the plugin route
> against `settings:stripeWebhookSecret` — never switchable off by any token. A webhook is
> always unauthenticated, and an anonymous request only ever reaches the host's *public*
> plugin-route dispatcher, so the route being public is structural, not a relaxation.
>
> **`OTTA_WH_TOKEN` is the cheap outer gate** in front of that anchor: it lets the public
> route refuse an *unattributed* request before it reads another kv key, builds a gateway or
> opens a store. Provision the same value on both halves — `wrangler secret put
> OTTA_WH_TOKEN` on the site and the matching field in admin Settings. Unset on the plugin
> side, the gate **passes through** (degrading to "cryptographic anchor only", never to
> "nothing works" and never to "nothing is checked"); set on the plugin side but unset on
> the site, **every delivery 401s** — that is the dangerous direction, and the reason the
> endpoint replays the 401 into Stripe's dashboard rather than swallowing it.

- **Stripe** — **set both the secret key and the webhook signing secret, or card checkout
  refuses every order.** The in-process commerce client builds the live Stripe gateway only
  when both are present (`packages/plugin/src/payments/stripe-wiring.ts`); with either one
  missing there is no `stripe` gateway at all, and card checkout fails before an order is
  created. That is deliberate, not a half-configured fallback: a gateway that could take a
  live payment but never verify its confirmation (or the reverse) would leave orders holding
  stock against a payment nothing can settle. Independently, until the webhook signing secret
  is set, the settle route answers `NOT_CONFIGURED`; it verifies deliveries with the
  **webhook secret only** (`packages/plugin/src/webhooks/stripe-settle-route.ts`). The pay
  page also needs the build-time publishable key, `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` — see
  [`sites/staging/README.md`](./sites/staging/README.md).

  With both secrets set, `createIntent` performs a real `POST /v1/payment_intents` over
  `ctx.http.fetch` (LIVE client secret, `metadata[order_id]` as the settlement key the
  webhook is matched on, the checkout `Idempotency-Key` travelling as Stripe's native one).
  Refunds from the admin console go to the same gateway (`POST /v1/refunds` over
  `ctx.http.fetch`, carrying the refund's idempotency key); with no gateway configured a
  refund is refused `REFUND_GATEWAY_UNAVAILABLE`. A live-intent failure (Stripe
  down or rejecting) refuses the checkout with `PAYMENT_INTENT_FAILED` and the `pending`
  order is kept deliberately — retrying with the same `Idempotency-Key` re-issues the *same*
  PaymentIntent, and the order-expiry sweep reaps it at the checkout TTL (releasing stock
  and any coupon use) if it never gets paid.

> **Live Stripe is TWO-DECIMAL currencies only.** Otta stores money as integer minor units
> at hundredths scale everywhere, while Stripe expects `amount` in each currency's own
> smallest unit. For **zero-decimal** currencies (JPY, KRW, CLP, VND, BIF, DJF, GNF, KMF,
> MGA, PYG, RWF, UGX, VUV, XAF, XOF, XPF) that would charge the buyer **100×**, and for
> **three-decimal** ones (BHD, JOD, KWD, OMR, TND) it is the mirror error — so the live
> `createIntent` **refuses them before any network call** with `PAYMENT_INTENT_FAILED`
> (provider code `unsupported_currency`). Do not price a catalog in those currencies on a
> deployment that takes Stripe payments. Lifting this needs an exponent-aware money
> boundary, not an adapter tweak — the deny-list is `STRIPE_UNSUPPORTED_CURRENCIES` in
> `packages/payments-stripe/src/index.ts`.

> **x402 settles against a real facilitator over `ctx.http`.** The configured facilitator
> credential goes **on the wire** as `Authorization: Bearer …` to the facilitator host, so
> provision a credential that was minted to be sent. The facilitator host must be in the
> plugin's `allowedHosts` — it is seeded at **build** time from the site's Astro config, not
> from `kv`, so changing facilitators is a rebuild, not a settings edit. The pay-to address
> and the accepted-networks list (default `eip155:8453`) are configuration, not credentials,
> and live alongside it in Settings.

- **Email** — with no email API URL baked in at build time there is **no sender at all**:
  nothing is logged or delivered, and the cron sweep's `order-emails` leg reports `skipped`
  rather than draining the outbox (`packages/plugin/src/email/ctx-http-email-sender.ts`).
  Only the API URL is build-time (`EMAIL_API_URL`, §4 — it also seeds `allowedHosts`); the
  API key is a write-only Settings credential, and the from-address ("Order email
  from-address", `settings:emailFrom`, default `no-reply@otta.local`) is a readable Settings
  field. **Magic-link login mail** goes out through the same sender, and only once Settings
  → "Sign-in link page" (`settings:loginLinkUrl`) holds the absolute URL of the storefront's
  `/account/verify` page — the emailed link points there and never at the request's origin.
  With no email API URL or no sign-in page URL, `requestLoginLink` answers the same generic
  success, issues nothing, and logs once server-side. For the reference site, set it to
  `https://<your-site>/account/verify`.

## 4. Egress and `allowedHosts`

The plugin's only egress is `ctx.http.fetch`, gated by the descriptor's `allowedHosts`
allowlist (capability `network:request`). That allowlist is resolved at **build** time
(`packages/plugin/src/manifest.ts`, fed by `sites/staging/astro.config.ts`) and contains:

| Host | When |
|---|---|
| `api.stripe.com` | always — the one constant entry |
| the email API host | when an email API URL is configured |
| the x402 facilitator host | when a facilitator URL is configured |
| the Solo API host | when `SOLO_API_URL` is configured before build |
| the e-racuni API host | when `ERACUNI_API_URL` is configured before build |
| the Woo webhook provider host | when `WOO_WEBHOOK_API_ORIGIN` is configured before build |

The two URLs are `EMAIL_API_URL` and `X402_FACILITATOR_URL`, read by
`sites/staging/astro.config.ts` from `process.env`, falling back to `sites/staging/.env`.
Set them in the shell or in `sites/staging/.env` **before** building (§2.1 step 4); unset,
the provider is simply unconfigured and no host is granted for it.

The new integration entries use the same build boundary. For Solo use the
documented public API endpoint as `SOLO_API_URL`; for e-racuni use the account's
qualified public JSON API endpoint. `WOO_WEBHOOK_API_ORIGIN` is the public
provider origin alone, without the generated destination path or token. Runtime
configuration must select an endpoint whose host the descriptor grants. No API
token, consumer secret or token-bearing destination belongs in `.env` or a Vite
define.

Stripe traffic goes through the same gate: `@otta-sh/payments-stripe` would default its
transport to `globalThis.fetch`, but the plugin constructs the live gateway with
`ctx.http.fetch` (`packages/plugin/src/payments/stripe-wiring.ts`), like the email sender and
the x402 facilitator client — so the allowlist is the perimeter for `api.stripe.com` too. This
closes the caveat recorded in
[ADR-0020](./adr/0020-one-deployable-plugin-owns-commerce-truth.md) §2.

Because it is build-time, adding a provider means a rebuild and redeploy — a Settings edit
alone cannot widen it. That is deliberate: the allowlist is the perimeter, and an operator
editing a text field should not be able to move it.

## 5. Operations & scaling

**Cron.** Two cadences, and they do different jobs. The **site's** Cron Trigger is
`* * * * *` — that drives the host's cron *executor*, which claims due rows from its own
task table. The **plugin** registers one task, `commerce-sweeps`, due every `*/15`; the
executor fires the plugin's `cron` hook when it comes due. That task drives all nine sweep
legs: they share a store composition and a clock, and splitting them would only put nine
rows in contention on the same documents.

The integration wrappers also register `commerce-integrations` and
`commerce-woo-webhooks`, each due every minute. The first handles bounded invoice
work; the second scans a bounded order page and attempts one signed delivery.
Disabled integrations do no provider work. Inspect the registered host tasks
after loading the storefront and before claiming that automation is operating.

Nothing needs to register that task by hand. The site lists the plugin in its `plugins`
array, so the host never fires `plugin:activate` for it; instead the plugin wraps its four
content-sync hooks and the two public catalog routes (product list and product page) in
`withSweepBootstrap` (`packages/plugin/src/cron/index.ts`), which ensures the task exists
once per isolate on the first such request and retries on the next if that write fails.

Every leg is **idempotent** and runs in its own try/catch with its own label, so a leg that
throws cannot starve the eight beside it; a tick always returns a summary, and each leg logs
one line on success and one `console.error` on failure (visible in `wrangler tail`). Per
[ADR-0019](./adr/0019-commerce-aggregates-are-one-document-each.md), these sweepers are not
an optimization — a coupling that spans two aggregates is made idempotently completable
rather than transactional, so **a missing sweeper is a correctness bug**. The site's cron
may be relaxed (e.g. `*/5 * * * *`) if cron noise ever matters more than publish latency,
but relaxing it past the task's own `*/15` delays every sweep.

**Scaling.** Commerce truth is one document per aggregate in the site's D1 database, written
by compare-and-set; every command carries an idempotency key the store enforces once-only,
and the sweeps are idempotent, so concurrent isolates racing the same sweep never
double-release or double-send. A hot aggregate therefore retries rather than blocking: the
contention budget is a measured number recorded in ADR-0019, not a hope. The scaling ceiling
is that single D1 database.

For backup/restore, invoice reconciliation, stock migrations and offline-payment
operations, follow [operations](./docs/operations.md).

**Upgrading and rolling back.** Deploy a new version **all at once** (`wrangler deploy`),
not as a gradual rollout that keeps old and new Workers serving side by side. A release that
changes a stored document's shape migrates it forward on first write, and an old Worker still
serving traffic can write the old shape back over it. The reporting day document is the live
case ([ADR-0023](./adr/0023-reporting-rollup-is-a-guarded-delta.md)). A pre-delta Worker's
**rollup** rewrites a migrated day document from the copy it read: any events counted since
that read are lost, and its own state move is kept only in an old-style field the new code
ignores. The next event on that day clears the old field in one write, logs a `tainted`
reporting anomaly, and carries on from the counters that survived. A pre-delta Worker's
**reconcile** writes the old shape back, which the new code migrates forward on its next
write. Either way the day's figures can be wrong (almost always low; a rare race during the
overlap can count one event twice) until a reconcile covering it runs, and
the scheduled reconcile reaches a day only once it has closed. So after a rollback past such a
release, or a rollout that overlapped versions, treat today's report figures as provisional
until then. Orders, stock and payments are unaffected — only the reporting rollup is.

## 6. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause → fix |
|---|---|
| Every SSR request hangs, nothing in logs | `global_fetch_strictly_public` + D1 `session` both on — pairing invariant violated (§2.4); turn `session` off |
| `/products` empty right after deploy | Healthy (§1) — sample content lands via the wizard checkbox, not first boot |
| `POST /webhooks/stripe` reports `NOT_CONFIGURED` | The Stripe webhook signing secret is unset — provision it in admin Settings (§3) |
| Every Stripe delivery 401s | `OTTA_WH_TOKEN` set on the plugin side but not on the site (or the values differ) — §3 |
| Sweeps never run | Nothing has bootstrapped the schedule, or the runtime wired no cron executor — check that the site's Cron Trigger is present and load `/products` or a product page once (§5) |
| An outbound call to Stripe / the email provider / the x402 facilitator never leaves | The host is not in the build-time `allowedHosts` allowlist (§4) — rebuild and redeploy |
